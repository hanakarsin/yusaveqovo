Some members of my family have been calling me to express embarrassment over the story but I told them not to worry because I played the game and I know what I feel.</p><p>“The story is making an impact with a lot of reactions, being a popular person, I cannot hide; Nigerians will be interested to know how their ex heroes are fairing, but I have told my family not to worry, that I will handle it.</p><p>“So yesterday, the Media Officer of the Super Eagles who works in a radio station called me to inform me that somebody wanted to speak with me and I said he should give him my number.</p><p>“Musa called me and said he had heard my story and that he and his teammates will do something but meanwhile, I should give him my account number and in about an hour’s time, I got an alert of N2 million, I appreciate that a lot.”</p><p>Obiekwu said he was forced to retire at 30 in 2004 due to health reasons, adding that a number of ex-internationals were passing through hard times.</p><p>He advised former players not to be ashamed to speak out instead of dying in silence and appealed to active sportsmen and women to save and invest their earnings to avoid running into hitches when they are retired.</p><p>He added: “If you don’t come out to tell Nigerians your story, they won’t know how to help you, So I encourage my colleagues to do what they can to keep body and soul together. there is nothing to be shameful for.</p><p>“As an ex-player, I want to advise the younger ones to save and invest because football and sports are something that you do within a period in life. If you retire, you begin to struggle if you don’t save enough.”</p><p>“In my case, I did not waste my money, at least I have a house. Imagine the landlord throwing your property out because you can’t pay rent, it would have been worse.</p><p>“Our club managers and administrators should also complement the effort of state governments by making sure they pay players and coaches.</p><p>“I have players in my former clubs whose marriages have crashed because they can’t provide for their families, you can’t develop football without developing those making it happen,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5BwZqKknGKzsL7Er5yrZZKaeqi%2BwK2cn62cYsGwecChpJ6cXaLCtK2Mn6arZZeew6q6xmaknmWeZ7puu8GinKSvpWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gongsam-table-html.html><span>←</span><span>Gongsam Table - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
