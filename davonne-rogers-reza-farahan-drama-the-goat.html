Sure, they are typically ridiculous, but we can't lie ‚Äî it's a great way to escape our lives and indulge in some deliciously guilt-free television.</p><p>One of our new favorite reality TV shows just so happens to be <a href=#>The GOAT</a>, a competition series pitting <a href=#>14 reality superstars</a> against each other for a grand prize of $200,000 and the coveted title of the "Greatest Reality Star of All Time."</p><p>The first three episodes are now available to stream on <a href=#>Prime Video</a> and Amazon Freevee, showcasing an abundance of messy conflict. Fascinatingly, the tension persists even post-filming, particularly evident in the ongoing feud between cast members <a href=#>Da'Vonne Rogers</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reza Farahan</a>.</p><p>Here's everything we know about their contentious relationship.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Jace Downs/Amazon Freevee</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Inside the drama between 'The GOAT' stars Da'Vonne Rogers and Reza Farahan.</h2><p>On May 3, Reza appeared on Jeff Lewis's SiriusXM show, Jeff Lewis Live, to discuss The GOAT. In a snippet from the episode, Reza can be heard criticizing Da'Vonne, or as he called her, "Quadzilla" (he said she has "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">quads of steel</a>").</p><p>Reza alleged that his friend and fellow Bravolebrity, Jill Zarin, let "Quadzilla" manipulate her during the game and experienced "emotional outbursts" because of her influence.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Thug‚Ä¶.

Reza then revealed, "So, she didn't end up coming to press day. I had to be re-grouped with other people because she had a problem with another castmate [who] didn't want to do press with her. And then, ultimately, she ended up canceling."</p><p>Reza further commented that Da'Vonne's game strategy was "straight out of the gutter," prompting Jeff to remark, "So she's a thug. ... she's the villain."</p><p>"Some might say she was playing a good game, but she brought nothing to the house," the ex-Bravo personality explained on the radio show. "She was in her room strategizing, [but] she didn't come across as the villain."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Pay attention to Reza‚Äôs gestures as he‚Äôs using the word ‚Äúgutter‚Äù (which was definitely a choice b/c ‚Äúcutthroat‚Äù was RIGHT THERE) ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ the gestures paired with the word gutter ‚Ä¶ it definitely gave ‚Äúshe‚Äôs black‚Äù ‚Ä¶.</p><p>But maybe I‚Äôm reaching ü§ß <a href=#>https://t.co/kdskD25nUv</a></p>‚Äî Da‚ÄôVonne Dianne (@DaVonneDianne_) <a href=#>May 3, 2024</a></figure><p>Just hours later, clips from the episode surfaced on X (formerly known as Twitter). Several fans promptly shared them with Da'Vonne, who simply responded, "Thug‚Ä¶. Gutter ‚Ä¶. I'll circle back to this video when the show airs."</p><p>In a follow-up tweet, Da'Vonne added, "Pay attention to Reza's gestures as he's using the word 'gutter' (which was definitely a choice b/c 'cutthroat' was RIGHT THERE) ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ the gestures paired with the word gutter ‚Ä¶ it definitely gave 'she's Black.'"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Reza was annoyed with Da'Vonne during a 'GOAT' challenge.</h2><p>Now, the brewing tension between Da'Vonne and Reza surfaces in Episode 3 of The GOAT, titled "Casualty of War." The cast competes in an untalented talent show, which Da'Vonne wins by strategically ranking other contestants lower to secure power for the week.</p><p>This plan annoys Reza, who believes he deserved to win but was deliberately given a low score by Da'Vonne, resulting in a narrow 87-85 loss.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>All I'm hearing is he is salty Da'vonne probably outplayed him</p>‚Äî Jammania Mania (@MJammania) <a href=#>May 3, 2024</a></figure><p>However, after Da'Vonne leaves an argument with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Johnson (aka Alyssa Edwards)</a> in tears, Reza is the only person who offers her solace and convinces her not to leave GOAT Manor. This obviously raises questions about his contradictory behavior ‚Äî they appear to be on good terms in the show, what unfolds next?</p><p>Only time will reveal the truth, but many viewers speculate that Reza's bitterness stems from being outplayed by Da'Vonne on the brand-new competition show.</p><p>Catch new episodes of The GOAT on Thursdays, only on Prime Video and Amazon Freevee.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma63u82nnGaqn5yys7%2BMq5yzmV2brrOtx5qlZpyilrqiedOhnGafn5bB</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gunmen-kill-eight-month-old-baby-seven-others-in-plateau.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Gunmen Kill Eight Month Old Baby, Seven Others In Plateau</span></a>
