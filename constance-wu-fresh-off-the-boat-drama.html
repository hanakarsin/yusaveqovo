What we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>When <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fresh Off the Boat</a> got renewed for a sixth season in May, fans were thrilled — until the series’ star, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Constance Wu</a>, went on a very uncomfortable Twitter rant.</p><p>Never has an actor so publicly expressed how disappointed they were that their successful TV show would be sticking around for another year. Will viewers be able to look past the controversy when the comedy returns on Sept. 27?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here’s how Constance Wu addressed her Fresh Off the Boat drama.</h2><p>On the same day ABC announced that the sitcom would appear in its fall 2019 lineup, Constance bemoaned the decision on her social media pages in a series of since-deleted tweets and comments.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>"So upset right now that I'm literally crying. Ugh. F--k," she wrote on Twitter, followed by a message that read, "F-----g hell." When a user congratulated her on the "great news," she replied, "No, it’s not."</p><p>She then took her tantrum over to Instagram, specifically to Fresh Off the Boat’s official account. On <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a post</a> that said, "The Huangs are back! #FreshOffTheBoat is returning for Season 6!" Constance commented, "Dislike."</p><p>The backlash against the apparently ungrateful actress was swift. "[Constance Wu] hope [your] career fails," one upset fan remarked, while another added, "Get [Constance Wu] off this show since she wants to be a whiny ass brat."</p><p>The Crazy Rich Asians star angered the internet further with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her response</a> to the fuss she created.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>"I love FOTB. I was temporarily upset yesterday not [because] I hate the show but [because] its renewal meant I had to give up another project that I was really passionate about," she explained, before ending her statement with a misguided reference to the Me Too movement: "It’s meaningful when you make the choice to believe women."</p><p>"Did you really just tie in your small misstep to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the larger issue</a> of believing victims of sexual assault?" one critic lamented on Twitter. "This could have all blown over until you had the audacity to add in that final sentence." A second individual noted, "you've just made your workplace <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">very awkward</a>... good luck."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Constance admitted that she was "so scared" to return to set.</h2><p>The Golden Globe nominee recently told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a> that she was worried about how her castmates would react to her outburst. "The public was so pissed off at me that I assumed they were, too," she confessed. "It was a lot of humble pie to eat, but I am really glad for it."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Constance revealed she was met with an "outpouring of support" instead of animosity. "I remember when we first had our gallery shoot coming back, I talked to [on-screen son] Hudson [Yang]," she shared.</p><p>"I said, 'Hey, I don’t know if this affected you, but I am sorry if it did affect you. And I want you to know that it’s not a reflection about how I feel about you or the show.' And he was just like, 'Constance, no, we love you. It’s OK, don’t worry about it. We know you.' I started crying. It was actually really moving."</p><p>Here’s hoping the Hustlers star will remember to think before she tweets. New episodes of Fresh Off the Boat air Fridays at 8:30 p.m. ET on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLyvv9OapZydXazCbrLRnqqhZZ%2Bbs27Ax55km6eRqXqlvsCmmA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./evan-sausage-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sausage - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
