In a situation like this, silence is not golden.”</p><p>“If the US president could be addressing Americans every day on the situation in Afghanistan, I also expect President Muhammadu Buhari to be addressing Nigerians either daily, weekly or fortnightly on the security situation across Nigeria.</p><p>“The usual statements from his media aides are not the solution. The president should create a situation room to brief Nigerians on the current situation and what his government is doing about it.</p><p>“Such action would allay the fears of the people. It is not enough to provide the security agencies with everything they need to prosecute the war, the president should take charge.</p><p>“He should also cultivate the habit of visiting places where incidents happen to physically assess the situation on the ground.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5FvZqysn6V6orDDq5ysq5mjtG66yKCcq6GRo8BuwMerpq6fmGLGsMHRZpiinJWoeq%2Bw1KacZpuYlr%2BosdJmp6udo56xprrTZpmuoJGntnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kellie-williams-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kellie Shanygne Williams - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
