Of course, at the age of 87, a generally weakened immune system can make the body more prone to illness in general.</p><p>We may never know the exact cause of Glenda's death, but what is clear from both looking at her biography and at the many tributes that have come pouring in since the news broke is that she will be missed.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Double Oscar-winning actress and former UK Labour MP Glenda Jackson dies aged 87 after brief illness, agent says <a href=#>https://t.co/LF5RWAwJc9</a></p>— BBC Breaking News (@BBCBreaking) <a href=#>June 15, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Glenda was a successful actor for several decades.</h2><p>Glenda won her Oscars for Women in Love and A Touch of Class, and after several decades as a full-time performer, she decided to shift her career away from acting and toward politics. Glenda became a Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate in the 1992 election, and her political career lasted for several decades until she retired in 2015.</p><p>More recently, Glenda had returned to the world of acting, and reports suggest that she had just finished filming a movie called The Great Escaper alongside Michael Caine. In 2018, she won a Tony Award for her performance in Three Tall Women, proving that she had not lost a beat since the 1970s. In both the acting world and the political realm, those who knew Glenda expressed their sorrow at the news of her death.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Devastated to hear that my predecessor Glenda Jackson has died.
