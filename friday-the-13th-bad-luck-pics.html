I couldn't make too much noise late at night for fear of attracting a "jinn."

Sure, we believed in supernatural stuff and the idea that karma gets back around to mess with you or your kids, but "bad luck"?&nbsp;</p><p>No honey, it isn't luck that's ruining your life, it's an unseen species of metaphysical monsters that exist in a different plane we know little about—but they are mentioned in the Quran, so be careful!</p><p>There are phenomena so unfortunate that simply looking at images of them will cause the same bad luck to befall you.
