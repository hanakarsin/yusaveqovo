Those doing large scale wheat farming in Kenya have understood what it takes to be a success. The following are conditions that favor the growth of wheat in Kenya.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/8a286f615cead63c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dania farming in Kenya: How to grow coriander and profit per acre</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Commercial Pig Farming in Kenya - A Brief Manual of Farming Methods</p><p class=align-left>- Gently sloping land that allows for mechanization.

It is crucial therefore to know how much you will need to make this project a success. You have to buy inputs and will incur other expenses. If you are leasing land, start your calculation from the costs of leasing land which would be about Ksh.3200 in a wheat growing area such as Narok. Ploughing cost would be Ksh.1500 an acre, Ksh.1200 for harrowing, Ksh.2000 fertilizer, Ksh.3000 for chemicals, and Ksh.1500 for harvesting costs.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs7l30kf2dsqh.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Pig farming possibilities for Kenyans</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Planning for such costs would work excellently for you. You do not have to worry about harvesting fees because this will be paid by the companies coming to buy the wheat while still on the farm. Wheat and barley farming in Kenya has grown because of the demand for these products. Companies are always on the lookout for farmers that have the products in bulk, therefore, the market will not be an issue. In fact, for wheat, the government buys from its farmers at a reasonable price per bag with last season going at Ksh.3400 per 90kg bag. With an estimate of 12 bags per acre, a farmer is able to calculate their potential profits before they can even decide to invest in this type of farming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs34ge26p0c0k.jpeg><h2><strong>Challenges in wheat farming</strong></h2><p class=align-left>There are certain problems facing wheat farming in Kenya just as is the case with other crops. The questions on how profitable is wheat farming in Kenya can only be answered after understanding the cost of the challenges and deciding if it is worth it. Wheat has a number of challenges including the following.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs438ju17rc59.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Is pig farming a good business?

It can be a major issue when droughts set in at the time when the crop is still at the maturing stage. This is because wheat requires well-distributed rain to mature. Things can also go south very fast when dry season is needed for ripening and harvesting, and instead, heavy rain falls.</p><p class=align-left>- Pests and diseases. This is probably the major problem when climatic conditions do not disappoint. Farmers need to be well prepared with herbicides to curb any problem that could arise from attacks by pests and diseases. You need to constantly talk to agronomist and other experts to ensure that you have the right pesticides for your wheat at every stage</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs7l30kf2dsqh.jpeg><p class=align-left>- Costly storage even after harvesting. Sometimes farmers are forced to sell their wheat at a throwaway price because they lack sufficient storage.</p><p class=align-left>Wheat farming is a very lucrative venture for Kenyan farmers, especially because there is enough demand for wheat both in the domestic market and also for export. If there is a way of curbing the challenges that farmers face and addressing the issues that affect production, then there is a chance that farmers could earn even more from this kind of farming.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs38bi926qkh4g.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bulb onion farming in Kenya made simple</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Viazi Karai Recipe: This is How We Do it Down in Coast</p><p class=align-left>Wheat farming can be very fruitful especially when done on a large scale because you are able to cut down on cost.
