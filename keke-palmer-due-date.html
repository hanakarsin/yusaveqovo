Celebrities certainly aren't obligated to share this kind of news with the public, so until Keke says more, fans will have to wait and speculate about when exactly she might be due. Whenever she has the baby, though, here's hoping that both she and it are healthy and happy for years to come.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Keke announced her pregnancy in dramatic fashion on 'SNL.'</h2><p>Given how good Keke has gotten at dominating conversation on the internet, it's no surprise that she chose to user her time hosting 'SNL' as an opportunity to reveal her pregnancy to the world. During her opening monologue, Keke walked out onstage and proudly declared that she was pregnant.</p><p>"There‚Äôs some rumors going around, people have been in my comments saying, ‚ÄòKeke‚Äôs having a baby, Keke‚Äôs pregnant,‚Äô and I wanna set the record straight ‚Äî I am," she said.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>"Even though some people feel a little weird about me having a baby ‚Äòcause I was a child actor, I just wanna say, ‚ÄòLook, I‚Äôm 29, I‚Äôm grown, I have sex [and] I own a home. ‚Ä¶ You know, things adults do.'"</p><p>All jokes aside, though, it seems clear that Keke is excited about the prospect of motherhood.</p><p>Previously, Keke opened up about wanting to become a mother, and how her own mom, Sharon Palmer, inspires her.</p><p>"[Parenthood is] being able to talk to my kids and to be able to inspire them and encourage them," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!
