When a product is good, you don’t need a lot of advertisement to sell it.</p><p>“Asiwaju is a very good product and in Delta state, I don’t see any difference in other parts of Nigeria, if Asiwaju can get it in other parts, he can equally get it in the South-South because he is a very good product to market on his own.</p><p>“It is easier for us to sell Asiwaju than some other persons that you will struggle and struggle to sell in the South-south. Asiwaju is a household name in the South-south.</p><p>“In my state, he is part of my state. To me, I will tell you that Asiwaju is from Delta state because in Itsekiri, they will tell you that the in-law is the third family member. So, after my father, mother, brother, the other person is in-law. Itsekiri or people from Delta don’t disenfranchise their in-law.</p><p>“Asiwaju equally has the same right as I do to partake in anything, to be part of any meeting and have his own fair share in anything.</p><p>“I can boldly tell you Asiwaju is from Delta state. Being that he is from Delta, Asiwaju is from South-south.”</p><h4>CAN Speaks On Meeting Tinubu Over Muslim-Muslim Ticket Controversy</h4><p>The Christian Association of Nigeria <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>(CAN) has denied meeting with Tinubu</strong> </a>or any of his representatives over the Muslim-Muslim ticket controversy.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> earlier reported that the Tinubu Campaign Organisation (TCO) spokesman, <strong>Bayo Onanuga,</strong> had said his principal is meeting with religious leaders and other relevant stakeholders to explain his choice of Shettima as his running mate.</p><p>Onanuga said the Tinubu camp decided not to make the latest development public until some issues are finalised, adding that there was an arrangement not to have it publicized.</p><p>He, however, disclosed that his principal would address the media when the consultations are done.</p><p>Reacting to the claim,<strong> Adebayo Oladeji,</strong> spokesman to CAN President, <strong>Olasupo Ayokunle</strong>, stated that Tinubu has not reached out to the association over the Muslim-Muslim ticket controversy.</p><p>Oladeji added that such a meeting has not taken place with Tinubu or his representatives ahead of the 2023 presidential election.</p><p>“I am not sure anybody has reached out to CAN, at least, not to my knowledge,” he said.</p><p>Also speaking, CAN General Secretary, Joseph Daramola, said Tinubu has not met with the CAN leadership, adding that the association could not be swayed into changing its stance on the controversial Muslim-Muslim ticket.</p><p>“I don’t know about that. I am in Abuja presently and I can tell you that I have not seen or met anybody that looks like Tinubu in person,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5FwZmtoYmh6sb7ErKCdnZ6Yxm7AyKesm61dna6quNJmnaunnWLAsMHToWSsp6WptW6wxKWrmmWjlsa0ecCpmmabmJ6yp8DAoqVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./romina-gafur-html.html><span>←</span><span>Romina Gafur - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
