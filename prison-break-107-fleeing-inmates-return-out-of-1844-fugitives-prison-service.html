Otherwise, they are potential dangers to everybody. I want to tell you that this approach is paying off.”</p><p>“As of this morning, the figure of returned inmates in Imo has risen to 107. Some voluntarily came back and some were arrested by the security agencies. Earlier, 11 were arrested by the Nigerian Air Force. We have sent a message to them that remaining a fugitive for life does not pay. We have their details with us. The criminals just burnt ordinary papers in our office but their details are on our systems.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH11e5BrZqmqmai8r3nBq5yao11mfXh5xaWcnqGenHqqusyaq56rXaeytcHRp2SoraRivKd5kHFrbWWWqrSqwMivnKxloKe2tLvNZqqeqqaesKZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./guy-rescues-bird-learns-lesson.html><span>←</span><span>Man Forced to Escape From Injured Bird He Rescued</span></a>
