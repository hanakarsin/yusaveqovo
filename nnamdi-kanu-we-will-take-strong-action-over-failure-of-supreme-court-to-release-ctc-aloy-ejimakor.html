The theme of our discussions centered on the persisting failure of the Supreme Court to certify its judgment & transmit the case file to the High Court. We shall take strong actions.”</p><p>On Wednesday, Ejimakor had complained about the delay of the CTC in a statement released saying, “the failure to release the said CTC is a flagrant violation of the Constitution that entitles Nnamdi Kanu to be issued copies of the judgement within seven days of the delivery of the judgement on 15th December 2023. It is a fundamental right and thus enforceable.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5BxZqemkaKxqnnKmqWuZaeaeri1y6VkrZmbmnq0wNGopaBlkZjBqrvNZqavnaJis6K1y66pnmWfm3q0wc%2BrnKadXZi8tr7TZquoZaKauaat0p5knKyTYq6tu9hmnKOhnZa4sL6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./423630-muranga-3-suspects-arrested-hidding-changaa-local-church-html.html><span>←</span><span>Murang'a: 3 Suspects Arrested while Hidding Chang'aa in Local Church</span></a>
