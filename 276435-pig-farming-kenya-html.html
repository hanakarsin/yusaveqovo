They construct a good gain of weight from feed compared to many other animals capable of meat production. To be precise, pigs fall in the second place after broiler chickens, when it comes to gaining weight efficiently. Pigs are efficient in the usage of different kinds of food such as forages and grains and transmute those into useful and nutritious meat.</p><p class=align-left>You can feed damaged cereals and leftovers to your pigs, and that in turn will lessen the pressure of having to buy extra food and other stuff for them.

It will help you determine the breeds which you are going to add to your piggery.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Landrace:</strong> This breed of pigs can be identified by its white colour and straight snout. Also keep an eye on the ears; if the ears are drooping, that is a landrace. The piglets produced by the sows have very lean meat and fine daily weight gain. Such meat is ideal for the preparation of bacon and pork.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Large white:</strong> Large white pigs can be identified by their straight ears and a little concave face structure. These pigs have long bodies, fine hair and fantastic hams. Large whites are really fertile and have good mothering capability. They can be used for the production of pork and bacon.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Camborough:</strong> Camboroughs are mainly imported from South Africa. This breed of pigs grows fast and contains relatively lesser fat. The sows are fine mothers and they do not lose their babies. They hold enough milk and feed the piglets well. Camborough pigs farrow thrice a year and produce approximately 14 piglets every time. One of the best qualities of this breed is that can be immune to diseases if taken care of properly.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Hampshire:</strong> This breed of pigs is one of the prime breeds in the world. Hampshires are developed in the United States and is mainly used as the male parent of cross breds for the production of bacon and pork. Hampshire is a fertile breed of pigs and they produce abundant leant meat. They are capable of producing more meat than Landrace and Large whites.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Duroc:</strong> Duroc can be identified by its black to golden brown colour, thick skin and auburn coat. Their ears are kind of smaller compared to others, and they are also a little droopy. Durocs are distinguished by their rapid growth, shoulder, big hams and deep body. Usually, this breed has been used as male parents for pigs. Durocs are good parents and a great choice for outdoor farming and commercial pig farming.</p><h2>Now on to the different pig farming systems</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs6mmdk3fpcks.jpeg><p class=align-left>There are three different pig farming systems from which you can choose. It basically depends on the capital you are ready to invest on your farm. Below are the three systems which have been described precisely for your understanding in this matter. You can then decide which system you are going to choose from.</p><h3>1. Free range pig farming</h3><p class=align-left>This is not really a commercial system and holds on more to the first and basic style of pig farming done in households. This kind of farming is also known as scavenging pig farming. Such system can provide the house with fund during emergencies and also provide meat in dire situations. If you were looking for something small to start with, this system might just be for you and it requires little time and money.</p><h3>2. Small scale pig farming in Kenya</h3><p class=align-left>Kenya has successful pig farming businesses. Some of the small scale pig farmers in Kenya utilize this system. It is a good arrangement where you keep pigs in a small farm or house and take proper care of their food and health. What you get from this is high production value while also marketing the pigs.</p><h3>3. Intensive pig farming</h3><p class=align-left>Now we are talking about the bigger fishing in the seas. You are going to make this arrangement when you have decided to enter the real market with efficient meat production and earn large amount of profit. You are going to need to invest a notable amount of money as well as time. Since it is no small thing, you will have to make proper calculations of the costs you are going to incur as well the kind of benefits you can expect. Be sure about this system as you will need to spend capital on pig requirements and modern housing, so that the feeding and health of the pigs are never neglected.</p><h2>Pig rearing in Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>As you decide on the above-mentioned systems, you will also have to work on pig production and pig rearing strategy.</p><h3>1. Farrow to Wean</h3><p class=align-left>You have a stock of pigs who are going to be the parents by giving birth to piglets. After the birth of the piglets, you will take appropriate care and rear them up to wean. Then, you can sell them to fatteners and growers. Remember, we are talking about selling only the piglets. Keep the parents for repeating the process.</p><h3>2. Farrow to Finish</h3><p class=align-left>In this part, you are to raise the piglets, rear them, have them grow with proper nutrition and good health, and fatten them. Do the process of fattening in one unit. Now, you can sell live pigs to slaughter houses and also sell pork. This strategy is adopted when the locality does not have any market for piglets.</p><h3>3. Fattening</h3><p class=align-left>In this strategy, your farm does not need to have parents. All you do is buy a lot of piglets continuously and rearing pigs for pork.</p><h2>Housing</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhsb5jguaebnse.jpeg><p class=align-left>Pigs can be very strong. Make sure that the living conditions for them are sturdy enough to take the impact. Shaded zones, as well as proper air circulation facilities, are among the most important requirements for your farm. In a general context, it could be seen that the piglets are too sensitive to cold temperature, whereas, the adult ones are sensitive to hot temperature. Pig farming in Kenya today is as popular and profitable as it has been all the time, provided the housing facilities are better. The measurement of the land should be around 60ft by 40ft.</p><p class=align-left>The perfect solution to this is a controlled temperature farm that can sustain all these conditions for a healthy growth of the pigs. The piglets need to be around their mother, so it will be better if you keep the mothers along with their baby piglets separately. Keep your house clean all the time. Bedding and feeding places are to be separated for a neater environment.</p><h3>Housing size requirements for pig farming in Kenya</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs7ihnv2h2rth.jpeg><p class=align-left>The age and sex of the pigs play a very important role in construction of the house. The floor should be 3X3 metres and the height of the floor must be roughly around 60 cms above ground level. The boards of the floor should be pure concrete built and should have 2 cms of space gap. Higher side of the roof should be facing towards sunshine and rain proof.</p><p class=align-left>The building should be divided into various pens for different phases of the production. The size and number of the pens depend upon the population of the pigs.</p><h4>Here are the space requirements for the different stages and ages of the growth of pigs for your pig farm.</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs1cbl5qffte5.jpeg><li>Pregnant sows 1.5 – 2.0 sq metres per sow</li><li>Fattening pig 0.5 – 1.0 sq metres per pig</li><li>Weaner piglets 0.3 – 0.5 sq metres per piglet</li><li>Lactating sow 4 – 6 sq metres per sow</li><li>Breeding boars 6 – 8 sq metres per boar</li><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Commercial watermelon farming in Kenya</strong></p><h2>Feeding</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs64j017p2pgb.jpeg><p class=align-left>Behold the most important part of the pig farming in Kenya which is undoubtedly feeding. Good production can always be guaranteed if the food provided to the pigs are nutritious and of good quality. Pigs consume both grains as well as meat.

In particular, FCR is the mass of the sustenance isolated by the weight increase, everywhere on a predefined period. Creature breeds with a low FCR are viewed as effective clients of feed.</p><h3>Average Daily Fain (ADG)</h3><p class=align-left>ADG is a huge factor in evaluating development rates in most sustenance creature species. Your point is that you keep a pig that develops fast, with the goal that you can accomplish market weights in most brief timeframe utilizing minimal measure of info/cost so you get the most noteworthy benefit. In production of pigs, the most cost-proficient feed transformation and the most elevated normal day by day pick up are the essential variables deciding productivity of creation.</p><h3>Health</h3><p class=align-left>Bad health will result in the increase of feed transformation ratio, which in turn will lessen the average daily gain. There are no limits to diseases and such like the African swine flu is capable of wiping out all of the pigs you own and result in a great loss.</p><h3>Genetics</h3><p class=align-left>The present market requests more slender carcasses, so you should endeavor to deliver more slender pigs, creatures with high development rate, bigger litter size, high heritability and low transformation proportion. All these are straightforwardly affected by hereditary qualities.</p><h3>Reproduction</h3><p class=align-left>Poor determination of the reproducing stock and decision of a pig or artificial inseminate will straightforwardly influence your pig cultivating business benefits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs19ius2q3kb1o.jpeg><h3>Market & price</h3><p class=align-left>The marketplace for pork and pigs may be large but it does not have any significance until you have determined which is going to be your market and what will be the offered price.</p><p class=align-left>We have numerous butchers, eateries, inns and stores building up today with pork on their menu; both in Urban and rustic zones.
