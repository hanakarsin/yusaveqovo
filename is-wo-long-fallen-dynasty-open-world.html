Here's everything you need to know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Team Ninja</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is 'Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty' an open world game?</h2><p>In an interview with the Spanish publication <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vandal</a>, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty producer Masaaki Yamagiwa explained the RPG has a quest-based structure with linear levels similar to <a href=#>Nioh</a> — meaning Wo Long doesn't have an open world.</p><p>Like Nioh, zones are sliced into missions with various interconnected routes. Those who have played the two Nioh games and didn't like the structure will likely feel the same through Wo Long.</p><p>However, despite the formulaic nature of its design, additions like the jump button in Wo Long to venture across vertical sections and the reactive combat aims to make progressing through the independent stages more exciting.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Team Ninja</span></figure><p>By doubling down on designing Wo Long this way, Team Ninja could introduce new elements in every map and expand their scope over those debuted in Nioh.</p><p>You can access these missions over the different acts in the game from Battle Flags, but you'll need to progress the main story to gain entry into newer ones with better rewards.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Finishing main battlefields will unlock new zones in 'Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty,' even unique additional content.</h2><p>While you are free to explore and re-try any available battlefield in Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, unlocking new main and side missions should be a priority to experience fresh challenges, earn items needed to <a href=#>upgrade your Dragon's Cure Pot</a>, and more. To do so, you'll need to finish the main battlefields that will push you through the different story acts.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Team Ninja</span></figure><p>Later on, side zones unlocked from completing the story will open up <a href=#>Wizardry Spell</a> mastery tests that can unlock even better abilities in combat. Also, it's possible to grind through additional levels at your leisure for a formidable boss battle or farm rare equipment for specific bonus stats.</p><p>How you chart your journey throughout Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is entirely up to you since you could simply focus on the main scenario battlefields and skip the side content to finish the game.</p><p>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is now available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuw85mo6iml2KzorjLnqVmnKmjrrTA2GamqZ2eYsSwvsud</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./t-o-p-html.html><span>←</span><span>TOP - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
