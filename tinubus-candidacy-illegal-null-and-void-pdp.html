This has led the court to nullify the candidacy of the Governor of Osun State, Oyetola.</p><p>“The same Mai Mala Buni was the caretaker chairman that sponsored the nomination of Tinubu. We are saying that if the process that sponsored the nomination of the presidential candidate of the APC was illegal, then the nomination of Bola Tinubu is illegal, null and void.”</p><p>However, the PDP <strong>National Working Committee (NWC)</strong> member refused to disclose if the party would e heading to the court to challenge Tinubu’s nomination.</p><p>“The PDP will not announce whether we are going to court. When we want to go to court, you will know,” Ologunagba stated.</p><h2>Wike vs Ayu</h2><p>On the crisis rocking the PDP over Governor Nyesom Wike of River State’s demand for the resignation of the party’s National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, he said, “You mistake Atiku to be PDP. Atiku is a product of PDP. I understand that Nigerians are legitimately concerned for the party but reconciliation is not a 100m dash, it is a marathon.”</p><p>Oloogunagba said the moves made by Atiku to reconcile Wike to the party have shown Nigerians that Atiku was a unifier.</p><p>He added. “Nigerians have accepted Atiku as a unifier, The multiple actions of the Board of Trustees, National Working Committee, and Atiku have given Nigerians reasons to trust us to bring all party members together. You will begin to see more actions. The NWC and the BoT are working. We are united, you saw that play out at the book launch of Solomon Lar.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49xZq2hnqqvtr%2BMnJinnJmZrqTFjKKjpZ2XlrluutSlo2aZnpl6t7vInWSpnKBk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./senate-president-lawan-denies-sitting-on-letters-of-defection.html><span>←</span><span>Senate President, Lawan Denies Sitting On Letters Of Defection</span></a>
