First, we asked him: What are your plans for Christians in the North in light of your insistence on picking a Muslim vice-presidential candidate from our region?</p><p>“We also asked him to respond to the remarks by Shettima at the NBA Conference that he will oversee security while Tinubu will direct the economy. Finally, we asked the APC presidential candidate for his views on the incessant attacks on Christian communities in the North.”</p><h2>APC Presidential Candidate’s Unconvincing Response</h2><p>Multiples sources told Vanguard that Tinubu spoke of the Muslim-Muslim controversy in a bid to allay the fears of the Northern Christians.</p><p>One of the sources said: “For our first poser to him, Asiwaju said much, but to summarise his response, he simply told us he cannot talk about sharing a cake that has not been baked.</p><p>“His response to our second question was that the Constitution specified the roles and responsibilities of the President and his vice. So, there is no doubt about who will do what in the office if they win 2023.”</p><p>On the killing of Christians in the North and possible Islamisation, another source said Tinubu said he would not be part of such an extremist agenda, stating that he has not Islamised his immediate family and wouldn’t do so to over 200 million persons.</p><p>Another source added: “Some of us are not satisfied with his reasons for picking Senator Kashim Shettima as his running mate. He failed to convincingly justify the fact that in all the eight Northern states dominated by Christians there was no qualified, politically exposed and upright Christian fit for the office of the vice president of Nigeria.</p><p>“We believe that Tinubu himself, like most of us at the meeting, is at a loss on how to convince Christians that he will not sideline the Church.</p><p>“How can we work for a presidential candidate who appears to be already sidelining people that are not of his faith?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5FuZqato6G2rnnMrqqloZ1iwaqvyp6rZqyYp7Kmecimp6iqpJa7tXnQrpysrJmku7R5waKqoaegqHqiv8qem2asmaPCo8GMq5yanF2WvaR5z6ucrKGUmru1tcClZJyZnpm2pa3TnmSrnaOlvK%2B%2FxGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chelsea-cant-win-premier-league-this-season-tuchel-admits.html><span>←</span><span>Chelsea 'Can't' Win Premier League This Season</span></a>
