Scroll down for everything we know about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joanna's upcoming cooking series</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Joanna Gaines getting a new cooking show?</h2><p>Yes, Joanna is currently working on a new cooking show for her dedicated fans. On Sunday, April 5, Food Network aired a one-hour special of all the cooking videos her kids have taken of her recently called In the Kitchen With Joanna Gaines. During the segment, she shared a sneak peek of her actual real cooking show that will be premiering on Magnolia in the coming months, and it got us so excited for this new venture!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Well, this is going to be fun! The “cooking show” videos that the kids filmed will be airing in a one-hour special on @foodnetwork this Sunday at 12p/11a CT! ⠀ ⠀ Plus, I’m sharing a sneak peek of my actual cooking show that will premiere on Magnolia Network in the coming months!</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Joanna Stevens Gaines</a> (@joannagaines) on Apr 2, 2020 at 8:01am PDT</p></figure><p>On Tuesday, April 7, the same day her new cookbook, Magnolia Table, Volume 2 came out, she and Chip shared an Instagram Live segment giving a tour of the Gristmill, which is a property they renovated for the show to be filmed in (there is footage of the space on her saved <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram Stories</a>). To no surprise, by the looks of all the wonderful changes they made to space, in addition to how successful her cookbooks have been, it's going to be quite an amazing cooking show.</p><p>The first rumblings of a cooking show from Chip and Joanna came during their appearance on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a> in November 2019. "I don't want to tell you how to do your network," the host joked to Joanna at the time. "But I would do a cooking show for you."</p><p>"I like that idea Jimmy, but you've got to talk to this guy," Joanna replied, pointing to Chip. Chip's response? "I'm cool with it. You're talking to the executives of the Magnolia Network."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Magnolia Table, Volume 2 comes out tomorrow (!!!) and to celebrate, @chipgaines and I were thinking it’d be fun to give a live tour of the Gristmill (which is where my cooking show will be filmed)!

While we don't know the exact launch date of Joanna's new cooking show, we do know that it will be on their new network, Magnolia, which is currently set to launch on Oct. 4, 2020. That said, we're hoping the cooking show, which is currently unnamed, will be gracing our TV screens early this fall.</p><p>This isn't the only exciting project coming to the Magnolia network later this year. There are two other series set to premiere on the channel. One is called Growing Floret, which will follow Floret Flower Farm founder Erin Benzakein and her team as they attempt to turn a 20-acre piece of land into an organic flower farm in Washington.&nbsp;</p><p>The other six-episode series is called Home on the Road, and will&nbsp;be a reality show starring their friends Abner Ramirez and Amanda Sudano Ramirez and their two kids as they tour North America with their band Johnnyswim.</p><p>We can't wait to watch Joanna in the kitchen once her new show starts (hopefully) very soon!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7yius2aZKCZmaOytHnNnq5mm5%2BkuKq6xmaqoaen</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-tinubu-will-win-2023-election-deji-adeyanju.html><span>←</span><span>'Why Tinubu Will Win 2023 Election'</span></a>
