And with a family like theirs, it seems like they are practically made for entertainment.&nbsp;</p><p>But <a href=#>how much does the Busby family make per episode</a>? Let's investigate...</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How much does the Busby family make per episode?</h2><p>We're not sure if we speak for the rest of America, but you can be sure that if we found out we were about to be mothers to six girls, we'd find any way possible to ask friends and friends of friends about any way to connect with someone who could open the path to reality TV.</p><p>Luckily for everyone, it seems like America wanted an inside look into how this family would get through their exponential expansion ‚Äî and the extra TLC pay certainly helped the Busbys make ends meet.</p><p>While there is no word on the official figures that Danielle, Adam and the rest of their family is bringing in per episode, reality producer Terence Michael has told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In Touch </a>that reality show families earn about "10 percent of the show's budget."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"This means that the Busbys would be raking in $25,000 to $40,000 per episode," he continued, calculating that TLC likely budgets about $250,000 to $400,000. Since In Touch's article dates from 2017 and the family has continued their success, we can only assume these figures keep rising.</p><p>Which is lucky in light of the financial drama peeking its head in the background of Outdaughtered's Season 6.&nbsp;<a href=#>Adam recently quit his job as an account manager for Intrinsic Solutions/Sprint Safety after working there for 12 years in favor of a more demanding role</a> that requires him to travel to Dallas and leave Danielle in charge of the six girls.</p><p>For her part, Danielle is beginning to resent Adam and wants to do more with her life than be a stay-at-home mom. "Before we had kids, she used to have a great career and the ability to travel and do all these fun things, but now her life is her kids," Adam understands. "She loves them, but also, she's kind of been losing herself in the process."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>When two show families collide... it‚Äôs been so great to hang out this week.
