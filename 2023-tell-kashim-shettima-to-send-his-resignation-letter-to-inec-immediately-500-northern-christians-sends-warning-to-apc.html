Dauda Yakubu, Pst. Yiguda Augustine, Diconess Jessica Nuhu, Elder Williams Unogwu, Dr. Theodore Uji, Pst. Ambas Kelvin, Mr. Haruna Vincent and Bish Emeka.</p><p>The group urged the APC to disembark from the same faith ticket, adding that it is a national threat and one that must not be allowed to stand.</p><p>They noted that the new electoral law makes it possible for a political party to change its candidates within 90 days to the election, insisting that the party make use of the law and do the needful.</p><p>They said, “Nigeria has already had enough insecurity and challenges, and contributing to further insecurity and challenges in the country should bother every well-meaning and concerned Nigerian.</p><p>“We understand that the argument against substituting the Muslim Vice Presidential candidate of the APC with a Northern Christian is based on its proponents because it is no longer possible. Still, we beg to differ by stating categorically that it is possible.</p><p>“To address this, a few steps must be taken, which in isolation or collectively will bring about the APC not fielding a Muslim-Muslim ticket but a Muslim-Christian ticket which, of course, should be the standard.”</p><p>Speaking further, the body told the APC to tell the party’s vice presidential candidate to write to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and notify them of his descion to resign with immediate effect.</p><p>They noted that after the resignation is sent, the party should also officially write to the electoral body and notify them of the former governor’s withdrawal from the race.</p><p>They maintained that this move would ensure a hitch free substitution of the party’s Vice Presidential candidate.</p><p>“The new electoral Act states that a candidate elected in the primary election of a party platform as its flag bearer for any position can resign his interest and withdraw from the contest by notifying INEC no later than 90 days before the election. If this window period is permissible for elected party candidates, how much more its surrogates</p><p>“If the APC can find a competent northern Christian to lead its 2023 general election campaign, finding a replacement for Kashim Shetima should not be a problem. APC should look through the many capable northern Christian members of the party who have contributed to its success since its formation and since its takeover of Nigeria’s national leadership.</p><p>“Neglecting these grievances around the party’s Muslim-Muslim ticket for the 2023 election could breed further resentment, costing the party its expected victory in the forthcoming election,” the statement added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5FuZmtoYmh6tbHLpWSkmaOdtq550qGcrayZoq5uwM5mqp6mlGK1qr%2BMq5ysoZejrrW1zqdkpZ2kqbKzedOoZKKmlZh6qrnMnpuimaSaubp5lGlnZqafp8GpsdGnZJygop7AtbXAp6pmq5WjsbR51pqpp6GenHq1u4yap5xn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mike-grzesiek-html.html><span>←</span><span>Shroud - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
