She claims to be a sweet heart but this is just a carefully crafted PR image. Funke Akindele claims to want to hind the faces of her children from the public to want them to have their life and protect them but she has no problem to anonymsonously feed distorted private information to slander my teenage son and her step son for that own personal vendetta to take the heat away from her marriage breakdown story. The hit job about my son came from her team as also suspected by her husband Abdul Bello her husband. If you don’t want me to expose your family then don’t expose mine. Funke and Abdul Bello.”</p><p>In another post, Mella claimed that Funke Akindele is a bully and not who she claims.</p><p>See photo below;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iu.jpg alt width=522 height=440 sizes="(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/92.jpg alt width=510 height=555 sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e5BtZp%2BZk5p6sLKMn6yno5Virqy1zZ2cpZ2jYsG4tc1mnLGon6iypXnBsmShraOXrq%2Bw0macsWWnnrOmew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kamar-de-los-reyes-cause-of-death.html><span>←</span><span>Soap Opera and Video Game Actor Kamar de los Reyes Died of Cancer at Just 56</span></a>
