(No surprise there, considering it's one of Bravo’s reality television creations.) The guys and gals of Leva Bonaparte’s Republic weren’t quite prepared for the arrival of a new staff member, or rather, a returning staff member.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reagan Hack</a> was welcomed back to the Republic family by Leva in Episode 6, and even though OG cast members know her and the drama that surrounds her, fans are asking for a bit more information.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Reagan Hack?</h2><p>A Greenville, S.C., native, Reagan, 23, has done quite a lot in a short amount of time. She previously worked at Republic but quit to travel the world with her boyfriend. Reagan also was a part-time waitress at a steakhouse restaurant, interned for the South Carolina House of Representatives as a campaign assistant, and held the part-time position of Client Sales Manager at a medical spa. After that, she earned her bachelor’s degree from the College of Charleston. Oh, and she’s a model at Ursula Wiedmann, too.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Now, Reagan is VIP of sales at Republic, plus she moonlights remotely for Palmetto Publishing as a marketing copywriter. According to a brief bio, Reagan wears a variety of hats, juggling a few part-time jobs. But her diverse schedule isn’t why cast members question Reagan’s dedication and sincerity. Apparently, she’s done one of their own wrong.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What’s the drama between Reagan and the ‘Southern Hospitality’ cast?</h2><p>Episode 6 aired some dirty laundry about Reagan and her previous relationship with cast member <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Kulp</a>. Reagan cheated on Will during their relationship and may have also cheated on her current boyfriend, Reece William, with another cast member/staff member, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bradley Carter</a>.</p><p>With that kind of a history with two Republic staff members, it’s understandable that bringing Reagan on board caused the hackles to rise for some other established cast members.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Reagan’s boyfriend Reece William?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Reece is a successful and relatively wealthy Charleston businessman who holds the title of principal/head of site acquisitions at Middleburg Communities. And he’s also a managing principal at Wayah Wake Real Estate Advisors.</p><p>Aside from one scrape with the law (a DUI some years ago), Reece appears to be a primarily upstanding citizen who prefers his privacy. His Instagram handle, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@younggreece,</a> is private.</p><p>That being said, some Southern Hospitality cast members have alluded to Reece being a possessive boyfriend who isn’t fond of Reagan returning to the Republic and its den of drama – not to mention the close proximity to some old flings and flames.</p><p>Only time will tell if Reagan’s return is harmful to the original cast’s dynamic or if all parties can let bygones be bygones.</p><p>Tune in to watch the drama unfold on Southern Hospitality onMondays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7Kis8CnZKGZk6B6tLvUrZ%2Beqp5itbC%2Fz6KrmqSZqcY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./291413-nyoka-akwama-mdomoni-mwa-jamaa-mmoja-nigeria-akijaribu-kufanya-uchawi-html.html><span>←</span><span>Nyoka akwama mdomoni mwa jamaa mmoja Nigeria akijaribu kufanya uchawi</span></a>
