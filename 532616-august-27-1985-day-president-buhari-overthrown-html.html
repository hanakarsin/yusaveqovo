Dasuki is the son of former Sultan of Sokoto Ibrahim Dasuki.</p><p>After the five men watched the evening news, the army officers arrested Buhari at gunpoint.&nbsp;At 6am on Tuesday August 27, 1985 Brigadier Joshua Dogonyaro announced in a nationwide broadcast that Buhari had been overthrown in a bloodless military coup&nbsp;led by General <a href=# title="Ibrahim Babangida" rel="nofollow noopener">Ibrahim Babangida</a>&nbsp;(who also&nbsp;unseated the elected civilian Government and installed General Buhari on December 31, 1983).&nbsp;After having a champagne breakfast to toast their success, the plotters' inner caucus held a meeting at Bonny Camp to flesh out details of the new leadership.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>1985 Coup: Mistakes That Led To Overthrowing Of Buhari</p><p>[article_adwert]</p><p>The meeting was attended by the following officers: Ibrahim Babangida, Maj-Gen Sani Abacha, Brigadier Joshua Dogonyaro, Brigadier Aliyu Mohammed (head of military intelligence), Navy Commander Murtala Nyako, Lt-Col Ahmed Abdullahi (Minister of Communications), Lt-Col Tanko Ayuba (commanding officer - Nigerian army signal corps), Lt-Col John Shagaya (commanding officer - 9th mechanised brigade, Ikeja), Lt-Col Anthony Ukpo, Major Abubakar Umar (Administrator of the Federal Housing Authority).</p><p>Nigerians were kept in the dark about the new leader until Maj-Gen Sani Abacha made a follow up broadcast at 3.30pm to announce that Babangida had been appointed the new leader. Babangida said he was unanimously chosen to lead by the new caucus without any disagreement.&nbsp;After the coup, Buhari was detained for more than two years, badly affecting his family life and causing him to divorce his wife Safinatu upon his release.</p><p class=h4>The coup speech that overthrew Buhari on August 27, 1985</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt22c6ae07oudg.jpeg><p>I, Brigadier Joshua Nimyel Dogonyaro, of the Nigerian&nbsp;Army, hereby make the following declaration on behalf&nbsp;of my colleagues and members of the Nigerian Armed&nbsp;Forces. Fellow country men, the intervention of the&nbsp;military at the end of 1983 was welcomed by the nation&nbsp;with unprecedented enthusiasm.&nbsp;Nigerians were unified in accepting the intervention and looked forward hopefully to progressive changes&nbsp;for the better. Almost two years later, it has become&nbsp;clear that the fulfillment of expectations is not&nbsp;forthcoming.</p><p>Because this generation of Nigerians and&nbsp;indeed future generations have no other country but&nbsp;Nigeria, we could not stay passive and watch a small&nbsp;group of individuals misuse power to the detriment of&nbsp;our national aspirations and interest.&nbsp;No nation can ever achieve meaningful strides in its&nbsp;development where there is an absence of cohesion in&nbsp;the hierarchy of government; where it has become clear&nbsp;that positive action by the policy makers is hindered&nbsp;because as a body it lacks a unity of purpose.&nbsp;It is evident that the nation would be endangered with&nbsp;the risk of continuous misdirection.</p><p>We are presently&nbsp;confronted with that danger.&nbsp;In such a situation, if action can be taken to arrest&nbsp;further damage, it should and must be taken. This is&nbsp;precisely what we have done.&nbsp;The Nigerian public has been made to believe that the&nbsp;slow pace of action of the Federal Government headed&nbsp;by Major-General Muhamadu Buhari was due to the&nbsp;enormity of the problems left by the last civilian&nbsp;administration.&nbsp;Although it is true that a lot of problems were left&nbsp;behind by the last civilian government, the real&nbsp;reason, however, for the very slow pace of action is&nbsp;due to lack of unanimity of purpose among the ruling&nbsp;body; subsequently, the business of governance, has&nbsp;gradually been subjected to ill-motivated power play&nbsp;considerations.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>Buhari Reveals He Knew Babangida’s Plans For 1985 Coup</p><p>The ruling body, the Supreme Military&nbsp;Council, has, therefore, progressively been made&nbsp;redundant by the actions of a select few members&nbsp;charged with the day to day implementation of the&nbsp;SMC's policies and decision. The concept of&nbsp;collective leadership has been substituted by stubborn&nbsp;and ill-advised unilateral actions, thereby destroying&nbsp;the principles upon which the government came to&nbsp;power. Any effort made to advise the leadership, met&nbsp;with stubborn resistance and was viewed as a challenge to authority or disloyalty. Thus the scene was being&nbsp;set for systematic elimination of what, was termed&nbsp;oppositions.</p><p>All the energies of the rulership were directed at&nbsp;his imaginary opposition rather than to effective&nbsp;leadership. The result of this misdirected effort is&nbsp;now very evident in the country as a whole.&nbsp;The government has started to drift. The economy does&nbsp;not seem to be getting any better as we witness daily&nbsp;increased inflation. The nation's meager resources&nbsp;are once again being wasted on unproductive ventures.&nbsp;Government has distanced itself from the people and&nbsp;the yearnings and aspirations of the people as&nbsp;constantly reflected in the media have been ignored.&nbsp;This is because a few people have arrogated to&nbsp;themselves the right to make the decisions for the&nbsp;larger part of the ruling body.</p><p>All these events have shown that the present&nbsp;composition of our country's leadership cannot,&nbsp;therefore, justify its continued occupation of that&nbsp;position.&nbsp;Furthermore, the initial objectives and programmes of&nbsp;action which were meant to have been implemented since&nbsp;the ascension to power of the Buhari Administration in&nbsp;January 1984 have been betrayed and discarded.&nbsp;The present state of uncertainty and stagnation cannot&nbsp;be permitted to degenerate into suppression and&nbsp;retrogression. We feel duty bound to use the resources and means at our disposal to restore hope in&nbsp;the minds of Nigerians and renew aspirations for a&nbsp;better future.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>Buhari’s Speech After 1983 Coup</p><p>We are no prophets of doom for our beloved country,&nbsp;Nigeria. We, therefore, count on everyone's&nbsp;cooperation and assistance. I appeal to you, fellow&nbsp;countrymen, particularly my colleagues in arms to&nbsp;refrain from any act that will lead to unnecessary&nbsp;violence and blood shed among us. Rest assured that&nbsp;our action is in the interest of the nation and the&nbsp;armed forces.&nbsp;In order to enable a new order to be introduced, the&nbsp;following bodies are dissolved forthwith pending&nbsp;further announcements: (a) The Supreme Military&nbsp;Council (b) The Federal Executive Council (c) The&nbsp;National Council of States.</p><p>All seaports and airports are closed, all borders&nbsp;remain closed. Finally a dusk to dawn curfew is&nbsp;hereby imposed in Lagos and all state capitals until&nbsp;further notice. All military commanders will ensure&nbsp;effective maintenance of law and order. Further&nbsp;announcements will be made in due course. God bless&nbsp;Nigeria.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgnR%2BlWptZpmlnMK0wIxrbmZpaW2CbrDAsmSpqpWotqWxza1km62Ylr%2Bqec6vnKusmKe8uLqNoaumpA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./beat-shazam-season-5-trailer.html><span>←</span><span>'Beat Shazam' Season 5 Features More Big Winners (EXCLUSIVE)</span></a>
