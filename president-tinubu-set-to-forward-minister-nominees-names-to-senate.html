I, however, don’t think the President needs up to 60 days to unveil his cabinet.</p><p>“He’s trying to get the right things done. You know the 10th National Assembly has just come on board and they were on recess for the Sallah break. As the break is now over, I can assure you that you will begin to hear names being rolled out.</p><p>“Asiwaju is still on track. He is a man of his word. And I can assure Nigerians that he’s not going to do anything short of his promises. He has also signed two or three bills into law in less than 30 days in office. That is legendary.”</p><p>The Director of Publicity for the APC, Bala Ibrahim also agreed with Ogbole.</p><p>He reassured the public that the President was not under any pressure and expressed optimism that the ministerial list would be presented after the Sallah break.</p><p>He stated, “The President still has time on his side to carefully choose his team. He is not under any kind of pressure. I don’t see any on his side. You can even see how the President extended his stay by moving from Paris to London.</p><p>“Does he look like somebody under pressure? If there is any pressure, he would have run back long before his arrival. However, we are optimistic that he will present his ministerial list after the Sallah break.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e49rZqmqlai2pbHNrWStoZ6qr7Z50p6rZqyfYrOwvtaaqZ1lnZ67qr%2FTnqlmpp%2Bitq%2BxxKxkp5mdmsBuwM5mqp6mkamycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./where-is-the-dating-game-killer-now.html><span>←</span><span>Where Is 'The Dating Game' Killer Now?
