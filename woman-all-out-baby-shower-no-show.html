Source: GettyIt's a bitter pill to swallow when you realize that while you may have a bunch of friends that the majority of them aren't going to be there for you when you want or need them the most.
Wanting to share good things happening in your life with someone else is about as natural as wincing in pain upon hearing a grating Influencer's voice, so when you're stood up by your friends on a special day it can be especially painful."><meta name=author content="Chauncey Koziol"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

In a montage that shows snippets of the preparation of the party along with text messages from the mom-to-be's friends who all canceled, the TikToker penned a series of text overlays telling the sad story.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@spins.in.circles href=#>@spins.in.circles</a><p>People can be cold üíîüò≠ she deserves so much more.. <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=heartbroken href=#>#heartbroken</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Only Love Can Hurt Like This (Slowed Down Version) - Paloma Faith" href=#>‚ô¨ Only Love Can Hurt Like This (Slowed Down Version) - Paloma Faith</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @spins.in.circles</span></figure><p>"POV: You spent weeks planning and preparing your besties baby shower...we were both so excited for the shower I start making all the fun decorations"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @spins.in.circles</span></figure><p>She showed off massive cardboard boxes painted to look like toy blocks a kid would play with along with a giant multi-balloon decoration, a special cake to mark the occasion, green macaroons, and sugar cookies with what appears to be an image of the polo logo guy about to whack a ball.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @spins.in.circles</span></figure><p>The camera then cuts to a text from the TikToker's friend saying that they're getting overwhelmed with messages from people saying that they can't make the shower. Then there's a cut to the hall they booked to have the shower and it's completely empty save for two people sitting at a table.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @spins.in.circles</span></figure><p>"17 people sent back an RSVP but not a single person came.

I understand that life happens- So please don't commit to events that you aren't 100% sure you will be attending. It would've been easier just to reschedule."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @spins.in.circles</span></figure><p>TikTokers who saw her post sympathized with the mom, with many stating that they would cut off those 17 friends and never speak to them again. Others said that they, unfortunately, learned the hard way who really cared for them during their pregnancies and that people's true character comes out during vulnerable moments in their lives.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @spins.in.circles</span></figure><p>Others also highlighted their own experiences in dealing with party/event ditchers and how crushing it is to see people not keep their word at the slightest inconvenience.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mmKWkXaTCtXnBmpmyZaOdvLix0WalqGWjnby4</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sameer-gadhia-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Sameer Gadhia - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
