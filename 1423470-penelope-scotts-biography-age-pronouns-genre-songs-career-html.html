In middle school, she began writing lyrics to songs, delving deeper into the <a href=#>world of music</a> when she got into high school. Her big break in music came in college when she produced and released <a id=https://hfvoyager.com/7424/ae/penelope-scott-capturing-the-anger-of-a-generation/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">her first song</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7ba4604391ae51ff.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Roxy Horner biography: who is Jack Whitehall’s girlfriend?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Penelope Scott's age is currently 21 years, although her exact date of birth is unclear.</p><h3>Music career</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7ba4604391ae51ff.jpg><p class=align-left>At the age of 20, the singer released her <a id=https://ftpunks.com/interview-penelope-scott-on-big-overwhelming-feelings-in-music/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first song</a> and posted short clips of some of the song on TikTok. Her song, <i>Sweet Hibiscus Tea,</i> was a massive hit on the video-sharing platform and quickly gained the singer a huge online following.</p><h4>What exactly is Penelope Scott's genre of music?</h4><p class=align-left>Well, most of her fans tend to think that her music does not fall into any conventional genre. When asked, the singer stated that her songs fall under a blend of the alternative and indie genres.</p><p class=align-left>However, she also added that her fans could not quite seem to figure out where <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">her music</a> fits. Penelope's often verbose anti-anthem songs have recently been the subject of controversy on TikTok. One of her massively popular tracks, <i>Cigarette Ahegao</i>, was banned on the video-sharing app.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a381bc9676027b12.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Niyola biography: who is the person behind the music star?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Still, Scott has enjoyed massive success in the <a href=#>music industry</a>, with her songs generating millions of views across the globe.</p><h4>Penelope Scott's songs</h4><p class=align-left>Here are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the songs</a> that have elevated Scott into her current popularity in the music industry.</p><ul><li><i>American Healthcare</i></li><li><i>American Healthcare (Glitzy)</i></li><li><i>Baxter 3rd Is Under Fuc*ing Siege</i></li><li><i>Dumpster</i></li><li><i>Feel Better</i></li><li><i>Hammerhead</i></li><li><i>Lavender</i></li><li><i>Lotta True Crime</i></li><li><i>Lukewarm</i></li><li><i>Mommy Fwiend</i></li><li><i>Montreal</i></li><li><i>Moonsickness</i></li><li><i>Phones</i></li><li><i>Public Void</i></li><li><i>Rät</i></li><li><i>Sweet Hibiscus Tea</i></li><li><i>You Should Know</i></li></ul><h4>How many albums does Penelope Scott have?</h4><p class=align-left>The singer has <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">six albums</a> to her name.

The somewhat complex track's lyrics seem to come from the perspective of an intellectual young lady who has seemingly studied something along the lines of modern tech.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c6293f2bac50ff29.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Interesting facts about Amber Rose: age, ethnicity, parents, tattoos, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The song has been widely regarded as a 'diss track' against popular tech entrepreneur Elon Musk. The billionaire, known for his incredible role in the rise of Tesla and SpaceX, features heavily in <i>Rät </i>in what can be defined as a love-hate depiction.</p><p class=align-left>At some point, Penelope seems to admire the tech magnate for his agenda to advance the human race. However, this soon changes when she realizes that Musk is just another businessman who seeks to profit from his tech inventions. To Penelope, the sad part is that the said tech is only affordable to a few people, leaving out the majority.</p><p class=align-left>The song then goes on to 'diss' tech magnates using Musk as their personification.</p><p class=align-left>Penelope Scott is the archetypal representation of the power of modern social media platforms. The singer has managed to bring out societal issues through self-produced music that pretty much fails to fit into any conventional music genre. Her massive following speaks a lot about her creativity and songwriting prowess.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1e602e10837645b0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=32><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Doja Cat’s bio: age, height, parents, ethnicity, boyfriend, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>Read also: </strong><a href=#>Patoranking biography: age, net worth, songs, house, where is he from?</a></p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Legit.ng</a> recently reported <a href=#>about Patoranking</a>, a highly popular Nigerian dancer, songwriter, and reggae-dancehall singer.
