Matt Klotz, the first deaf contestant in Big Brother history, has been <a href=#>covering up his tattoo</a> of the Olympic rings with the Deaflympics logo added to the center ring with flesh-colored tape.</p><p>The reason for Matt covering up his ink hasn't been revealed, but it could be because of one of these reasons:</p><ul><li>The tattoo is protected by copyright</li><li>CBS doesn't want to show the Olympics logo, as the event is an NBC broadcast</li></ul><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>When it comes to Blue's tattoo on her left arm — which showcases a woman with blood dripping from her eyes in the shape of a heart — fans believe Big Brother blurred it out because of copyright issues.</p><p>"A tattoo artist owns the copyright for the tattoo that they do, so essentially Big Brother/CBS needs permission to be able to show them on TV or they can be sued," a fan on Reddit <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Another person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">added</a>, "Clearing them gets hard mainly because we have to track down the tattoo artist. Many times, people show other artwork for the tattoo artist to work on that you have to find that copyright. It is a lot of work for a minimal feature, so blurring ends up being easier."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7aoecGrpq2glad6o7jUnqpmrJGpwbC7jJujrqqimrE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bbyambi-html.html><span>←</span><span>Bbyambi - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
