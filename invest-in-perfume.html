But some people aren't so "live and let live" and believe that their predilection towards <a href=#>high-priced</a> fragrance purchases affords them some type of superiority.</p><p>Twitter user @Nancibarra wrote, "Idk who needs to hear this but invest in that $200 perfume. There is no reason you should be in your 20s wearing bath and body works LOL."</p><p>It's not difficult to argue that paying for a product based on its ingredients and quality is ultimately "worth it." Ferragamo's got a lifetime warranty on its shoes (they can be re-heeled and the leather can be re-treated), RRL jeans can easily be worn for years and years and years, and the materials and craftsmanship in these products are usually top-notch.</p><p>But what about the economics of creating fragrances? While there are some perfumes and colognes that contain hints of oils, spices, and natural aromas that cost a pretty penny (orris absolute costs $50,000 per kilogram, and oud oil sells on average for $30,000/kg) but the majority of top-shelf designer brands don't include these scents in their fragrances.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Idk who needs to hear this but invest in that $200 perfume.

According to Jean-Claude Ellena, the actual perfume itself, bottle and all, really only costs about 6% of whatever they're charging. So that $200 bottle of perfume is really only $12. But some industry experts put that cost as much lower.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’m 22 and want to smell like I’m 22 ain’t no way in hell I’m paying 200 to smell like my grandma .😒</p>— TAI🐲 (@OnlyTajanaii) <a href=#>December 25, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>$200 on perfume? 🥴🥴🥴 That’s two weeks' worth of groceries.

The rest is packaging, advertising, and margins...the cheapness of the formula is the main reason why most ‘fine’ perfumes are total crap."</p><p>Alyssa Harad writes in her own book, Coming to my Senses: "often the actual cost of a perfume in a fifty-dollar bottle of commercial stuff is pennies."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>As someone with a ridiculous collection who’s far more interested in fragrance than the average person, I wish y’all would just let people live lol.
