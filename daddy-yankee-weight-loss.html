On May 18, the King of Reggaetón posted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a video</a> of himself in all-black workout gear, running up steps while holding weights. In the caption, he asked, “Who put on weight in this quarantine? Now who’s signing up to lose it?"</p><p>The best thing about Daddy Yankee’s road to losing weight and getting fit is that he’s so open about it on his social media. The very next day on May 19, he posted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another video</a> of himself, this time doing a cardio workout with a jump rope. “I’m still on a mission,” he told fans.</p><p>Daddy Yankee has made it clear that he just wants to get back in shape and that he’s not on an out-of-control weight-loss mission. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> a #TBT picture of himself on a paddleboard looking extremely fit and jokingly asked, “Who’s THIS,” in the caption.&nbsp;</p><p>He also said in Spanish that his goal “is to be like this guy, back in 2011.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Daddy Yankee (@daddyyankee)</a></p></figure><p>Daddy Yankee has been extremely public about his training and likes to share his workouts in order to motivate others to get fit as well.&nbsp;</p><p>He loves cardio and, in addition to jump rope and running, Daddy Yankee likes to make his workouts fun. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another video</a> he posted of himself “doing cardio in an entertaining way,” he's catching and throwing a baseball in three rounds of 30.</p><p>He also does a lot of weight and strength training, as he’s shared on his Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>The "Gasolina" singer posted a lot of different types of weight exercises, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dumbbell presses</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">battle ropes</a>, which he does to increase his overall strength.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, all of Daddy Yankee’s hard work paid off.&nbsp;</p><p>By July 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he had lost 25 pounds</a> and posted his results to his social media with the caption, “The sacrifice is hard but in the end you see the results.” You sure can!&nbsp;</p><p>The reggatonero looks fitter and leaner than ever, especially when compared to the early days of his training videos.&nbsp;</p><p>Daddy Yankee has also been honest with his struggle to lose weight and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said that</a> “Patience and discipline are vital not to be discouraged.”&nbsp;</p><p>Although he was still some pounds shy of his goal, Daddy Yankee said, “I hope someone gets motivated today to start making a change in their life. Health comes FIRST!”</p><p>We’re cheering for you from the sidelines, Daddy Yankee!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma6lsNhmsJqmm5qybsPEop6hrF2hvLS%2F</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./646654-minimum-wage-ben-bruce-warns-governors-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ben Bruce Tackles Governors Over Minimum Wage</span></a>
