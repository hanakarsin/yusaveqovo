He, however, also firmly believes in second amendment rights and believes that a stop-gap solution to in-school violence is arming teachers in the classroom. Dog also said that he thought Michelle Obama would make a great president. He also attended Donald Trump's presidential inauguration.</p><p>Dog's daughter Bonnie has also accused him of racism and homophobia. She and her half-sister Cecily told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> that they were not invited to Dog's recent wedding to Francie Frane.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook post</a> following the news, Bonnie explained that the reason she wasn't invited is that she chooses "to participate in social justice and BLM protests" and wouldn't condemn streaming service <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">UnleashedTV after it fired Dog</a> when he used racial slurs. "I can't defend my dad's racism," Bonnie wrote.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>When Dog the Bounty Hunter finds Brian Laundrie before the FBI does will people see how much of a joke the national security agencies are?

Many believe that Brian is fleeing authorities and is in hiding in connection with Gabby's murder.
