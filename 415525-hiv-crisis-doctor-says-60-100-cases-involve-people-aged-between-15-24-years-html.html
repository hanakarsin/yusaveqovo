The prevalence is 29%, but we are worried more about infertility.

Meaning there is a need for us to look at this triple pandemic beyond the <a href=#>COVID-19</a> because this is our future generation,'' she said.<p class=align-left>She also said that the country's demography shows that almost 70% is made of young people.</p>''So, 10 to 15 years from now, who will contribute to the country's GDP? If they are being infected and being limited by the virus. Maintaining one client who is HIV positive per year is around KSh 7,000 if they fail on the first line and move them to the next line, it almost triples. So it is almost KSh 21,000, which is not sustainable,'' Ngugi said.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a93ca954be5858ff.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Michelle Obama Celebrates Daughter Sasha's Birthday: "Proud of the Woman You Are Becoming"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>According to Ngugi, there is a need for all the concerned stakeholders to put in place measures and prevent HIV infections in young people.</p><p class=align-left>Kenya needs KSh 84 billion annually for HIV, TB, malaria and <a href=#>family</a> planning.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
