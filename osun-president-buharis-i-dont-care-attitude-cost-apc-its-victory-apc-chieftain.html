The president is the leader of the party and he doesn’t appear concerned if the party collapses under his watch.</p><p>“Under President Buhari, APC governors worked against the party in Edo state similar to how figures in his cabinet have been fingered in the loss of Osun state. But Mr President won’t lift a finger to either reprimand these party saboteurs, instead, he signals tolerance that further emboldens them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5BwZqirpaN6sb7ErKCdnZ6peqPBx5qpoqtdnnqlu82tZJyZopp6osDToquunJVisLC%2F02aYqZtdnsG0edWimq2noq56orzCZpqhoZWbwaK1zWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./breaking-lionel-messi-joins-psg-on-two-year-contract.html><span>←</span><span>Lionel Messi Joins PSG On Two-year Contract</span></a>
