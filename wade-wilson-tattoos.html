On June 12, 2024, a Florida jury found him guilty of killing Kristine Melton, 35, and Diane Ruiz, 43. The murders happened within 24 hours of each other in October 2019.</p><p>Beyond the gruesomeness of his crimes and the nonchalant manner in which Wilson carried himself in court, people following this case have been fascinated by his tattoos. Since his arrest the day after the crimes, Wilson's body art has increased in number and, at times, offense. Let's take a look at the evolution of Wade Wilson's tattoos.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: The News-Press (video still)</a><p>Wade Wilson's first court appearance via video chat in November 2019</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Wade Wilson before he got his face tattoos is still pretty upsetting.</h2><p>Local Fort Meyers news station <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WINK News</a> has been following Wilson's story since the beginning. Like anyone with eyes, they have taken note of Wilson's ever-changing skin designs. His first mug shot, which was taken Oct. 8, 2019, shows a slightly smiling Wilson with several visible neck tattoos. According to the outlet, the words "bred for war" are directly under his chin.</p><p>His first court appearance happened via video chat from the Lee County Jail on Nov. 20, 2019, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The News-Press</a>. He's too far away to see if any changes to the neck tattoo have occurred, but what we can see is a quarter sleeve on his left upper arm. A police officer holds a phone up for Wilson so he can hear what the judge is saying. As he turns to leave we see his right arm, which doesn't appear to have any tattoos at all.</p><p>A few weeks later, Wilson had an in-person court appearance where we see his head has been shaved. It's unclear if the enormous swastika tattoo on the right side of his head is new, or was it covered up by his hair. Either way, it paints a terrifying picture.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Wade Wilson's face tattoos appeared in 2024.</h2><p>Wilson was back in court in 2024, which was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At this time, he had about five years to make some changes to his physical appearance and he really went whole hog. There are now several tattoos on Wilson's face, including a small swastika beneath his right eye. The word "glory" is written on his right temple. Lines have been tattooed perpendicular to his lips, with two more lines coming out from either side of his mouth. It gives his face a skeletal appearance.</p><p>Jury selection began in June 2024 and with that, more body art was added to Wilson's face. There is shading along that entire side which looks even more like half a skull. There are words written from the stop of his left eyebrow, all the way down around his eye, which are difficult to read. What we can see is "HA HA HA." It's hard to know why these decisions were made, whether it was out of boredom or a desire to frighten the jury. Either way, he was found guilty.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrK6lsYywoKWrn6N6ta3Traaoqw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1374579-ti-children-what-rappers-big-family-html.html><span>←</span><span>T.I. children: What do we know about the rappers big family?</span></a>
