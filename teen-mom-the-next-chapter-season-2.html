And in an exclusive look at the <a href=#>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</a> Season 2 trailer super tease, we get a closer look at where the moms are now and where they're headed.</p><p>Spoiler alert — some of the kids of the Teen Mom stars (stars who aren't teens anymore themselves, by the way) are starting to date. For other Teen Mom cast members, though, the second season of the spinoff is about working on personal relationships and maybe even moving on from some if you ask <a href=#>Jenelle Evans</a>. Because, oh yeah, she's back in some capacity and we get a shot of her in the trailer.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: MTV</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">'Teen Mom: The Next Chapter' features the return of Jenelle Evans.</h2><p>In the trailer for the second season, Jenelle sits down with Briana DeJesus. She admits that she needs to be far away from her estranged husband David Eason, but also her mother. Do we sense a potential new storyline for Jenelle, should she return in a full-time capacity? One of the reasons Jenelle originally left the series was because David wasn't able to film with her.</p><p>Now that they're separated, perhaps all bets are off. With Jenelle's appearance in Teen Mom: The Next Chapter, viewers are closer than ever to seeing the former problem child grace the small screen again. And for Jenelle, there is no shortage of things cameras could document, including her relationships with her mom and David, and Jenelle's relationship with eldest son <a href=#>Jace Evans</a>, who was reported to have run away multiple times from 2023 to 2024.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Amber Portwood's daughter Leah wants her step-mom to adopt her.</h2><p>Another takeaway from the super-tease trailer is Gary Shirley's announcement that his and Amber Portwood's daughter, Leah Shirley, wants her step-mom to adopt her. In the past, Leah expressed how close she feels to her step-mom. While Amber tends to have mixed emotions about their relationship, this whole adoption thing is sure to be a point of contention for Amber.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">When was Season 2 of 'Teen Mom: The Next Chapter' filmed?</h2><p>Given that Jenelle's appearance in the season comes hot off her heels of her separation from David, it's likely that Season 2 of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter was filmed before and after March 2024, when the news broke of the separation. That also means that MTV might be able to have Teen Mom shows airing at a near constant rate, since Teen Mom: Family Reunion ended right before the premiere of The Next Chapter.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: MTV</span></figure><p>For most fans, though, getting a new season of a show in the Teen Mom franchise multiple times throughout the year isn't a bad deal.</p><p>Watch Teen Mom: The Next Chapter on Thursdays at 8 p.m. EST on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbKmuoympqZlpJ2ybrrEsatmm5iWvbWx0WaqnpmjpLtufg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nigerian-newspapers-daily-front-pages-review-wednesday-29-december-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Nigerian Newspapers Daily Front Pages Review</span></a>
