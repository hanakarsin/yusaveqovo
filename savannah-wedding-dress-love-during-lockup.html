Dating an incarcerated person is never easy, but for Savannah on Love During Lockup, she’s taking matters into her own hands. In an exclusive clip obtained by Distractify ahead of the Sept. 1 episode, she goes wedding dress shopping — but she isn’t even engaged. And it’s hard to say if that’s even in the cards for her and boyfriend Jake."><meta name=author content="Lourie Helzer"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

In an exclusive clip obtained by Distractify ahead of the Sept. 1 episode, she goes wedding dress shopping — but she isn’t even engaged. And it’s hard to say if that’s even in the cards for her and boyfriend Jake.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Although Jake has mentioned wanting to potentially see other women when he is released and he doesn’t want to live with Savannah, she isn't going to let a silly thing like multiple red flags deter her. Instead, she says in the clip, she sees the “unconditional love” between herself and Jake. And she’s ready to take the next step, regardless of what Jake has said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Savannah looks for a wedding dress on ‘Love During Lockup.’</h2><p>In the clip, Savannah visits a bridal boutique with her friends to look for bridesmaids dresses for her friend’s wedding. But Savannah drops a bombshell on literally everyone when she says that she’d like to look at wedding dresses. Savannah’s friends have their concerns about her relationship with Jake.</p><p>However, she doesn’t seem to want to hear any negativity as she tells the salesperson about her dress requirements, being that she plans to have a prison ceremony.</p><p>“There’s a couple things that it has to be, ‘cause there’s some restrictions for it,” Savannah says in the clip. “Has to be past my knees, can’t be too fitted.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Savannah has spoken about the dress code as a visitor in prison before. She shared a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a> in February 2022 about wearing leggings and being forced to change her clothes before she could visit with Jake. A wedding dress may be a whole other ballgame. But we hope Savannah doesn’t actually show up in a dress one day and catch Jake completely off guard.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jake isn't fully committed to Savannah.</h2><p>Savannah says herself in the Love During Lockup clip that she knows it doesn’t look good on the outside. She points out her less than great relationship with Jake’s mom and the fact that Jake doesn’t want to be exclusive. But, she adds, there are “Reasons” behind Jake’s feelings and his actions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It's hard to say if Savannah showing up at the prison in a wedding dress will change anything, though. And let’s hope she doesn't actually plan to do that. But Savannah is serious about shopping for a wedding dress and moving forward with her relationship with Jake. She just may get hurt in the process.</p><p>Watch Love During Lockup on Fridays at 9 p.m. EST on WE tv.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqK63rc2nmKFlp5qxpbXNoGSdqpWowG64zq%2BcZpylp7avs4ylppyjpaU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./425174-baringo-chief-who-opted-trek-nairobi-meet-uhuru-stadium-finally-arrives-html.html><span>←</span><span>Joseph Chebii: Baringo Chief Who Opted to Walk to Nairobi to Meet Uhuru over Stadium Arrives</span></a>
