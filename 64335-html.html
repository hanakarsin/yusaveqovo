He said that there was a wrong impression that he claimed not to be a Nigerian.</p><p><i>"During the period of publicising "Twelve Years a Slave", I was asked where I was originally from. I suppose I was trying to give an honest answer about where I was born, and so, I said London, which is where I was born. And to me, it was a surprising reaction that people then concluded that I didn’t identify as Nigerian.</i></p><p><i>"Of course, I am Nigerian-British, but if they ask me where I was born, I can’t say Enugu, because I wasn’t born in Enugu, but, it doesn’t mean that I don’t identify as Nigerian.</i></p><p><i>"I am proud of being Nigerian that I am extraordinarily happy to be here to make this film. We wanted to make a film in Nigeria for several years, maybe 20 years. Several years we talked about making a film in Nigeria, internationalise the market, we know there is so much, there’s a handful of energy and ability in Nigeria.</i></p><p><i>"And, for those of us that were born overseas, we want to get back into all of that and try to work together and make films and internationalise what is a wonderful market community."</i></p><p>Biyi Bandele, who directed "Half of a Yellow Sun" said, the movie is essentially a love story. According to him, it’s about people falling in love and the sacrifices you have to make sometimes when you are in a relationship.</p><p><i>"It is about a generation of Nigerians who grew up in the 1960s which is when Nigeria, along with most African countries gained independence. And, this is a generation of Africans, of Nigerians, who were so imbued with confidence, with enthusiasm, with optimism about the future of the country and Africa."</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3V%2Fkm5loaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./you-cannot-intimidate-me-i-was-a-minister-before-becoming-governor-wike-blasts-kinigbe.html><span>←</span><span>'You Cannot Intimidate Me, I Was A Minister Before Becoming Governor''</span></a>
