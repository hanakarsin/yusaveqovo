According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>, Dynasty’s past renewals were spurred by a lucrative deal between Netflix and CBS Studios — the studio behind the show — but the show had been plagued by disappointing ratings in recent years.</p><p>And Dynasty was one of many shows The CW axed this year. “Look, none of these were easy decisions,” CW CEO Mark Pedowitz told reporters in May, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Line</a>. “We had long conversations with our studios and parent companies, and everyone recognized that this was a time of transition for The CW. So, unfortunately, some difficult financial and strategic decisions needed to be made at every level.”</p><p>Michael Michele, who plays Dominique Deveraux on Dynasty, honored the show’s legacy on Instagram after its cancellation, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">writing</a>, “It was a hell of a fun ride! Thanks to all the fans, cast, and crew who kept it alive and going for five full seasons.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 5 will likely hit Netflix in August, at the earliest.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Dynasty (@cw_dynasty)</a></p></figure><p>Robert Christopher Riley, who plays Michael Culhane on the show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> last October that the cast and crew were filming 22 episodes for Season 5. The 17th episode of the season is scheduled to air on Friday, July 8, so if there are 22 episodes this season and The CW airs a new episode each Friday from then on, then the series finale won’t air until August 12.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix Life</a>, seasons of CW series tend to hit Netflix a few days after their season finales, so Dynasty Season 5 might start streaming on Netflix later as early as mid-August.</p><p>Meanwhile, new episodes of Dynasty air Friday nights at 9 p.m. ET on The CW.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmuoyiqmarlZbAsLqMbmSonl2Zxq%2Bt0q2wZpuforavs4yorK1ln6N6r7HTn6OisA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./toby-keith-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Toby Keith's Wife?
