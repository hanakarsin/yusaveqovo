Among all the several calls for state creation, none is more compelling for than for the elevation of the FCT to a state status to correct the current statelessness facing millions of the people, and improve their representation,” Zikirullahi said.</p><p>On her part, the Minister of State for the FCT, Hajiya Ramatu Aliyu, while noting the concerns of the people, said that the resettlement and compensation of the original inhabitants of the nation’s capital remain a burning issue for the Federal Government.</p><p>She said, “President Muhammadu Buhari is supportive of the preservation and protection of the rights of the original inhabitants and also their heritage and culture.</p><p>“Though resettlement has been a difficult thing for us, and that has not been achieved. But in these engagements with the people, we will realise how we can robustly harness their potential, strengthen and galvanise support for them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5FwZqudo6m%2Ftq%2FTrqmeZZ6etKa%2ByJpknqSVq661sYyama6ikWLBsHnSrZitnV2owaLA1Kxkn5ukYravsMignKedo2LBprjLZp2gZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matty-healy-tattoos-explained.html><span>←</span><span>Matty Healys Tattoos, Explained: Meaning and Backstory</span></a>
