Source: YouTubeUnless you've been living under a massive rock, you have most likely watched an episode or two of Big Brother on CBS. The popular reality series is premiering Season 21 on Tuesday, June 25 at 8:00 p.m., and I'm literally dying of anticipation.
And regardless if you've watched the show since it first aired back in 1997, or if you've never even heard of it, you should definitely brace yourself to watch this new season."><meta name=author content="Hettie Henneman"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The popular reality series is premiering Season 21 on Tuesday, June 25 at 8:00 p.m., and I'm literally dying of anticipation.</p><p>And regardless if you've watched the show since it first aired back in 1997, or if you've never even heard of it, you should definitely brace yourself to watch this new season. Spoilers were released from a CBS All Access audio leak, and it looks like it's going to be a wild one.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">We know one of the upcoming heads of households.</h2><p>Reality TV news site, Gold Derby, broke down the network's audio leak with some juicy insight.</p><p>According to the site, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christie Murphy was unveiled as the first HoH</a> (aka Head of the Household) for Season 21. In the clip, the reveal was brought to light when a group of women were talking, and there was a knock at the door.&nbsp;</p><p>The person asked Christie to "use her HOH shower," and she says yes. So, there you have it.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">We know the first target.</h2><p>Another scandal was revealed when the conversation turns to who will go up on the block... the new HOH basically says that Kathryn Dunn isn't safe.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Hollywood gossip site, Celebrity Dirty Laundry, Christie was overheard saying Kathryn has been paranoid, and constantly accuses her of plotting against her. So it's pretty clear from the get-go that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kathryn is the first target</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Oh, and there will definitely be more.</h2><p>Kathryn won't be the only one to face the block, though. According to Celebrity Dirty Laundry, the other target will most likely ensure Kathryn does —&nbsp;in fact —&nbsp;go home.&nbsp;</p><p>Really hoping for the best for Kathryn, but I guess we'll see what happens there.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There are more house guests than originally planned.</h2><p>During the house tour, according to Celebrity Dirty Laundry, there were 20 place settings at the dinner table.&nbsp;</p><p>But since there are only 16 houseguests, that means a) there are four additional houseguests or b) vets are coming back as "camp counselors" for<a href=#> the camp-themed house</a>. It's unclear why this might be, but it definitely means something!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Luckily, the list of house guests is pretty impressive.</h2><p>The guest list for Big Brother Season 21 includes <a href=#>a wide variety of super interesting people</a>, which —&nbsp;of course —&nbsp;makes for the best kind of drama. First off, there's Cliff Chogg III, a petroleum engineer from Houston, Tex. Then there's Tommy Bracco, the Broadway dancer from New York City, and Nicole Anthony, the preschool aide from Long Island, N.Y.&nbsp;</p><p>My favorite, however, has to be Holly Allen. She's a wine safari guide from Wyoming, and<a href=#> she used to date Luke Pell, from Bachelor Nation</a>. Bottom line: if she doesn't win, I will be tremendously disappointed.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>Sounds like we've got plenty to look forward to when it comes to the upcoming season. But get ready for a whole lot of drama, because it looks like things are about to go down in the Big Brother house.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7aoecGrpq2glad6tLHArKanZWJmerS8zqKjnqqj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nnamdi-kanu-you-are-a-bunch-of-cowards-massob-slams-northern-group.html><span>←</span><span>Nnamdi Kanu: 'You Are A Bunch Of Cowards'</span></a>
