Luckily, there are some details out about the third installment of the reality show that takes couples who are at a pivotal time in their relationships and helps them make tough decisions.</p><p>After the first two seasons of The Ultimatum, the series even got spinoffs with and international versions in France and South Africs, and The Ultimatum: Queer Love. The latter focuses on relationships once again, but with cast members who are queer or non-binary individuals. Regardless of which show you prefer (because there are some strong feelings among fans about both), the general agreement of fans is that they want more of the franchise.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When does 'The Ultimatum: Marry or Move On' Season 3 premiere on Netflix?</h2><p>The first two seasons of The Ultimatum premiered in April 2022 and August 2023 respectively. Clearly, there is little rhyme or reason to how the seasons are released on the streaming platform. That being said, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a>, Season 3 of The Ultimatum premieres in December 2024.</p><p>While that might not make for a timeline that fans expected, it's better than ending the year without a new season at all. And it means that, well after seasons of Perfect Match and Too Hot to Handle have ended, viewers can once again flock to their screens, both big and small, to watch another Netflix reality show centered on couples.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Ultimatum (@ultimatumnetflix)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The cast for Season 3 of 'The Ultimatum: Marry or Move On' is totally new.</h2><p>The beauty of this show is that, while the format remains the same, the cast changes each time around. A group of five or six couples, who are all unsure about their next steps, agree to meet other potential partners and essentially swap mates for several weeks. Then, at the end of this period, the original couples get back together to see where their heads are at.</p><p>At the end of each season, the couples have to decide if they want to get married, move on separately, or move on with someone else entirely. Season 3 takes yet another batch of couples, only this time it's in Arizona. The previous two seasons took place in Texas and North Carolina.</p><p>Stream The Ultimatum: Marry or Move On on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWmedSlq6KlkanCrnnMmqmrsV2kv265zq%2BcZqeeYsCmrdKopWZr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rosey-sin-html.html><span>←</span><span>Rosey Sin - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
