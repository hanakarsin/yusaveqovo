So, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is Greyhound based on a true story</a>?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Greyhound' was inspired by true events, but the movie isn't based on a true story.</h2><p>At the focal point of the movie is Ernest Krause, a professional marine whose first mission as a Naval Captain involves overseeing a convoy of 37 ships as they make their way across the Atlantic Ocean.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>"In Greyhound, which is inspired by a true story, Krause leads 'an international convoy of 37 Allied ships [...] in his first command of a U.S. destroyer, crosses the treacherous North Atlantic while hotly pursued by wolf packs of Nazi U-boats," reads the official synopsis cited by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Mail.</a></p><p>Based on The Good Shepherd, a 1955 book by C.S. Forester, the movie zooms in on a Captain's firsthand experiences with commanding a group of veteran marines. The only one out of the group who hasn't been to war yet, he develops a sense of inferiority that impedes him from performing his duty to his best abilities.&nbsp;</p><p>The Good Shepherd revolves around how the Captain manages to seed out his negative thoughts and overcome his crippling sense of self-doubt. The book also offers insight into the difficulties posed by the increasingly obsolete technological apparatus. Communicational failures play a significant role in the unfolding of the narrative. The malfunctioning radar equipment and the HF radio bear an equally disastrous impact on the operation, Wikipedia notes.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>Although The Good Shepherd was inspired by true events ⁠— the Battle of the Atlantic was the longest-running military campaign to take place during WWII — its main character is fictional.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Greyhound' was written by Tom Hanks.</h2><p>Directed by Aaron Schneider — the creator behind the 2003 Two Soldiers, the 2009 Get Low, and the 2014 Into the Storm — the war drama promises plenty of spectacularly shot battle scenes, an action-packed narrative, and a close exploration of the internal life of an experienced marine who faces unfathomable dangers for the first time in his life.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>Written by Tom Hanks — who also penned the script of the 1996 comedy-drama, That Thing You Do!, and the 2011 Larry Crowne — the movie will feature a healthy ratio of eerily beautiful explosion scenes, insightful dialogues exploring the tense relationships between various crew members, and a handful of flashbacks capturing Ernest Krause's faraway past as a civilian.&nbsp;</p><p>Elisabeth Shue is set to play Evie, Ernest Krause's long-lost lover, while Maximilian Osinski will appear in the role of Eagle. Other cast members include Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Karl Glusman, Stephen Graham, and Lee Norris.&nbsp;</p><p>Greyhound will premiere on June 12, 2020.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnL%2BmxceorKecXaK8t7XEZqurrZViwLW70bI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jada-pinkett-smith-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jada Pinkett Smith - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
