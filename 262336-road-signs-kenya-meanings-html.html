Therefore, it is integral for the public to learn more about the four categories of road signs in Kenya and their meanings to create a safe environment. In some countries, there are up to 5 types of traffic signs.</p><h3>Class A – Regulatory road signs</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/15704375cd8b925f.jpeg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs3n47egmdg8j.jpeg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/df6c384d62ed86f0.jpeg><p class=align-left>The first class of road signs in Kenya referred to as <a id=https://www.supaquick.com/blog/traffic-signs-for-road-safety href=# rel="nofollow noopener">regulatory signs</a>, ordinarily, have a circle with a blue or white background. All circle road signs fall under this category. However, sometimes you might find some Class A signs on the road with an octagon or inverted triangle.</p><p class=align-left>You will notice from the road signs and meanings chart that the octagon is often associated with the stop sign, which is very common on the roads, and you probably would not miss it. Drivers ought to adhere to the regulatory signs no matter what.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/e183667eb5918ea9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Opinion Space Kenya survey panel review: is it worth joining?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The Class A signs are designed to inform road users of the laws they ought to comply with except roundabout, give way, and stop signs.</p><p class=align-left>Driving schools are tasked with ensuring that all road users, especially motorists, know and understand these signs. This is why taking tests before being licensed as a <a href=#>valid driver</a> is necessary.</p><p class=align-left>Some of the regulatory road signs on Kenyan roads are impossible to miss or ignore. Red circles are harsh warnings as they are must not do, and drivers should never neglect them. On the other hand, the blue circles indicate things that drivers must do on particular roads. Ignoring these could easily work against you.</p><h3>Class B – Warning signs</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/70feb3e17dbdd9f3.jpeg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/98d2b5312b1169dc.jpeg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/e183667eb5918ea9.jpeg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/f3600f49def14666.jpeg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/5d3664d5e777824f.jpeg><p class=align-left>The second category is the warning or class B signs. These prohibitory road signs are meant to pre-empt a hazard ahead and prepare the driver to take caution. They are mainly red triangles with black symbols except for two chevron signs with styled arrows. Some of the most common warning road signs on Kenyan roads include:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c5ccdb75456c7e39.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best tyres in Kenya (with prices): The most reliable brands</span></p></a><ul><li>Falling rocks ahead signs.</li><li>The river bends crossing road signs.</li><li>Blinds spots road signs.</li><li>Speed bump road signs.</li><li>Traffic merging head signs.</li><li>Traffic signals ahead signs.</li><li>Uneven roads surface ahead road signs.</li><li>Riverbanks without barriers ahead road signs.</li><li>The road narrows from the right and left ahead road signs.</li></ul><p class=align-left>All you have to do is check for the road signs with names and learn how to interpret them because a slight variation in a sign could change its meaning. Also, if you miss a meaning, you are likely to cause an accident, and you do not want that to happen.</p><h3>Class C – Traffic lights</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/635d705a9f36f363.jpeg><p class=align-left>Categories C possesses various numerous traffic light signage that represents different instructions and alerts to the road user. For instance, the traffic light signals, red, green, and amber, must be adhered to at every junction to ascertain proper traffic flow and avoid confusion on busy roads.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0cff054b8cff0718.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Container houses in Kenya: A complete guide</span></p></a><p class=align-left>According to the Traffic Act (p. 218), the sequence of the lights shown to control the movement of vehicles shall be:</p><ul><li><strong>Red</strong>: All automobiles approaching this light ought to stop before crossing the stop line. Drivers should not cross the stop line unless the traffic light turns green and proceeding does not endanger other road users' lives.</li><li><strong>Red and amber (</strong>light up together): Immediately after the appropriate duration, the traffic light turn amber in addition to the red that lit to stop the driver earlier. Drivers shouldn't move since the red light is still on and its impact active. Only when the red and amber switch off are vehicles allowed to proceed. Overall, they imply an impending change.</li><li><strong>Green</strong>: The green light signifies movement, and when on, the amber and red are off. This way, drivers can approach the junction, but must strictly adhere to other road safety rules. If there are uniformed police at the intersection, drivers must obey their instructions as well.</li><li><strong>Amber:</strong> The amber light, illuminated alone, follows the green light that notifies drivers to move. All vehicles that are in motion on the lane when the light comes up must stop. The only exception is automobiles that are too close to the stop, and terminating their movement would endanger road users' lives.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/65977b834747a31a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Highway code in Kenya: All you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The most <a id=https://kenyadrivingquiz.wordpress.com/2016/11/22/traffic-lights-are-also-part-of-the-road-signs-of-kenya-and-the-drivingtest/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">important rules</a> include these four combinations. However, it is strongly recommended that you read all the traffic rules and strictly follow them to avoid accidents. Also, this helps you from being fined for <a href=#>traffic offences</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Sometimes, you might find some traffic lights with other bulbs and arrows that help in directing traffic. For instance, a green arrow pointing to the left tells the driver that they can proceed to that section of the road regardless of other lights' state. The opposite is also true, whereby the arrow might be in red.</p><h3>Class D – Carriageway and kerb markings</h3><p class=align-left>These types of road signs are ordinarily painted on road surfaces and kerbs. Often, they are in yellow or white. You have probably noticed continuous or broken lines on highways that split road lanes between oncoming and ongoing traffic on single-carriage roads. This is an excellent example of carriage and kerb markings in Kenya.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9fc6af29b8c6e4b5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 20 least marketable courses in Kenya in 2024 (updated)</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>Yellow:</strong> Often, the longitudinal ones are used to regulate and separate traffic flow in opposite directions. Usually, they should be on your right-hand side when you are driving. In other instances, the yellow lines are used to mark kerb markings to imply that you are not allowed to park or stop in that area.</p><p class=align-left><strong>White</strong>: Usually, they are seen on carriageways and kerbs. Continuous longitudinal lines are restrictive while broken ones are permissive. In an instance you see double continuous lines, you should know that there is maximum restriction. Thus, you are prohibited from crossing or straddling them.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Kerb markings</strong>: Continuous yellow lines indicate that all vehicles are prohibited from stopping or parking beside the line. The only road users allowed to stop beside the lines are bicycle riders.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Pedestrian crossings: </strong>These are common, especially on busy roads. The Zebra crossing, for instance, indicates that pedestrians are crossing in that area. It is among the significant road signs in Kenya. Usually, they are painted in longitudinal or sometimes along with traffic flow directions. You might also spot them in perpendicular or transverse lines.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/da07c28b88f77346.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dreamline buses online booking routes, fares, and contacts</span></p></a><p class=align-left>One of the most common such signs on Kenyan roads is the Zebra crossing. You will find this among the most crucial road signs and their meanings during driving classes because of its colossal safety significance. It is painted on the road in areas where people or children often cross to give them the right of way.</p><h2>What are the 8 colours used for road signs?</h2><p class=align-left>In addition to understanding Kenyan road signs and their meanings, you may also want to know what the colours on them mean. Below are the most common colours used on the Kenyan road signs:</p><h3>Black and white</h3><p class=align-left>They are often used in informatory and regulatory signs. For instance, they are used in marking speed limits. If you have noticed, most speed limits are in black and on white backgrounds.</p><h3>Yellow</h3><p class=align-left>The yellow colour is common with warning signs. It may indicate that one is supposed to slow down or drive with caution. At times, it may be used together with the green colour.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6c2988e28295318b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to register a church in Kenya</span></p></a><h3>Orange</h3><p class=align-left>Like yellow, it may be used to warn motorists of a temporary. For example, they may be used on signs that inform motorist about ongoing <a href=#>construction work</a>. Often, the orange colour is used alongside a black one.</p><h3>Green</h3><p class=align-left>Green is usually used for guide signs. For example, they are used to tell motorist where they are and the road they are supposed to take. Also, they indicate the distance one is supposed to cover to reach their destination.</p><h3>Brown</h3><p class=align-left>Brown is used on signs that convey less critical information. They are meant to command the attention of a motorist. Where are they used? Parks and recreation parks.</p><h3>Blue</h3><p class=align-left>Similar to green, blue is used for guide signs. The colour is common on signs that indicate rest places, gas stations, hospitals, and lodging.</p><h3>Red</h3><p class=align-left>In most instance, red indicates danger. For this reason, it is used on signs that pass crucial/regulatory information to motorists. Overall, it is among the most important in the 3 categories of signs (warning, regulatory, and warning).</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b3419e115ea0675d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>A complete guide on living, working and doing business as a foreigner in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Motorists and pedestrians must abide and adhere to the road signs and meanings as stipulated by the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA).
