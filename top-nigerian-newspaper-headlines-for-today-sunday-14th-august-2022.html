2022.</h2><p>The&nbsp;Nigerian Labour Congress&nbsp;(NLC) has countered the recommendations made by the Nigerian Governors in order to rescue the country’s economy.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;had reported that the governors had asked the Federal Government to&nbsp;sack federal civil servants older than 50 years&nbsp;and offer them a one-off retirement package.</p><p>In their recommendations to President Muhammadu Buhari, the governors also advised the government to raise the Value Added Tax (VAT) to 15-20 percent and introduce a flat rate of 3 percent.</p><p>The governors said their recommendations were part of coordinated efforts to instill fiscal discipline and prevent the nation from imminent economic collapse.</p><p>However, in a letter dated August 8th and signed by its President,&nbsp;Ayuba Wabba, and sent to President Buhari, the NLC urged the federal government to raise taxes across the board for the rich.</p><p>The NLC also advised the federal government to make a 50 percent salary review of workers, due to current global realities and also warned against the increase of VAT.</p><p>There is division among governors elected on the platform of the&nbsp;Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)&nbsp;over plans to remove the National Chairman of the party, Senator Iyorchia Ayu.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;reports that removing Ayu is one of the conditions tabled by Governor&nbsp;Nyesom Wike&nbsp;of Rivers State for peace to return to the party.</p><p>Wike and his loyalists – which includes some governors – are calling on Ayu to resign as he had promised to step down if the presidential candidate of the party comes from the northern part of the country just like him.</p><p>However, some governors opposed to Wike’s demand believe that&nbsp;even if Ayu should step down, it should not be now to avoid a crisis that might rock the political boat of the party and lead to its defeat in the election.</p><p>The crisis has polarised the PDP Governors Forum, as well as other organs of the opposition party, including the National Working Committee.</p><p>The National Chairman of the&nbsp;All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Adamu Abdullahi, may not serve to the end of his tenure as plots have begun to remove and replace him with a Northern Christian.</p><p>Strong indications have emerged that APC governors and other stakeholders wants Adamu replaced by a Christian from the North-Central and this might be carried out during the ruling party’s upcoming&nbsp;National Executive Council (NEC)&nbsp;meeting scheduled for September.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;recalls that Adamu had in March emerged as the APC chairman after backing from&nbsp;President Muhammadu Buhari&nbsp;despite APC governors throwing their weight behind a former Nasarawa State Governor, Tanko Al-Makura.</p><p>A member of the National Working Committee (NWC) told Saturday Sun that the ongoing financial audit, non-payment of staff salaries and inability of the party to meet other financial obligations, were already generating concerns.</p><p>He said APC governors, who are worried about the fallout of the Muslim-Muslim ticket, are planning to replace Adamu with a Christian from any of the six North Central States.</p><p>Aisha Wakil, better known as ‘Mama Boko Haram’, has been sentenced to seven years imprisonment for N66 million fraud.</p><p>Naija News reports that Justice Aisha Kumaliya of the Borno State High Court gave the judgement, EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, said this in a statement on Friday.</p><p>Recall that the Maiduguri zonal command of

2019.</p><p>The defendants were alleged to have, on September 7, 2018, induced one Ali Tijjani and his company, AMTMAT Global Ventures, to supply N51 million worth of processed maize grain, also known as ‘biski’, for which they refused to pay.</p><p>According to the EFCC, AMTMAT Global Ventures processed and funded the trip of the trio to Morocco to the tune of N15 million, “a cost they refused to defray.”</p><p>The presidential candidate of the&nbsp;Peoples Democratic Party&nbsp;(PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has promised that lecturers will never embark on strike if he becomes the next

youth is the right to education, stressing that he has been investing in education for the past 30 years.</p><p>The PDP Presidential flagbearer reiterated his intention to have a youth-inclusive government if elected as President in 2023.</p><p>The Governor of Plateau State,&nbsp;Simon Lalong, has written to Catholics, tendering an apology over comments he made referencing Pope Francis.</p><p>Recall that while defending his decision to accept his appointment as Director-General of the All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Council, Lalong had told State House correspondents that as a born, baptised and confirmed Catholic, who has the highest award from the papacy, Knight of Saint Gregory the Great, the Pope has not told him there was anything wrong leading the campaign of a Muslim-Muslim ticket.</p><p>He had said, “For those who are talking about Muslim-Muslim ticket, I don’t even know where they are. I Hold a Papal Night and as a Catholic, everything we do, we do it and we send the advice to the Pope. The Pope has not told me that what I’m doing is bad as Director-General.”</p><p>His comments had received widespread backlash from Christians,&nbsp;especially Catholics, for dragging the name of the Holy Father into politics, with some calling for his suspension as a Papal Night for&nbsp;alleged blasphemy.</p><p>In a letter to the Catholic Church through the Bishops’ Conference, Lalong admitted making an error when he linked Pope Francis with Nigeria politics.</p><p>Ahead of the 2023 general election, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar and Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State will sign a peace accord soon.</p><p>Adamawa State Governor,&nbsp;Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri&nbsp;on Saturday disclosed this to Journalists upon arrival from River state.</p><p>He said&nbsp;“I’ve just returned from Rivers State where I met with my brother Governor Wike and I can assure you that we’ve started talking and very soon we’ll be crossing the Ts and dotting the Is.</p><p>“Politics is all about discussions, meetings, give and take and I can assure you that the reconciliation process started is going well and PDP will come out successful.”</p><p>The Governor, who is the chairman of the reconciliation committee set up by the presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, remarked that Nigeria is sinking and may not survive if the APC is allowed beyond 2023.</p><p>Ahead of the official commencement of campaigns for the 2023 general elections, presidential aspirants interested in having their posters in Anambra State will have to pay N10m each to the state government.</p><p>Other categories of candidates seeking political offices will also pay various sums of money to have their campaign materials displayed.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;understands Senatorial candidates will pay N7million, House of Representatives candidates will pay N5mllion; and State House of Assembly candidates will pay N1mllion.</p><p>This was made known on Saturday in a statement issued by the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Anambra Signage and Advertising Agency (ANSAA),&nbsp;Mr Tony Ujubuonu.</p><p>The statement however added that posting of posters on bridges, road demarcations; street light poles, roundabouts and public buildings remain prohibited.</p><p>The&nbsp;Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, also known as Miyetti Allah, has dragged Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State before the International Criminal Court (ICC), Hague, over the alleged seizure of cows.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;reports that the National Secretary-General of the Fulani socio-cultural group,&nbsp;Saleh Alhassan, stated this while reacting to the inauguration of the state’s Community Volunteer Guards.</p><p>In a statement on Friday, Alhassan said&nbsp;Governor Ortom&nbsp;will face justice for allegedly&nbsp;seizing over 25,000 cows belonging to members of the group and detaining over 4,000 herders.</p><p>The Miyetti Allah alleged that the Benue governor has violated the rights of Fulani herders in his state, adding that Ortom was known for seizing cows belonging to Fulani herders.</p><p>The presidential candidate of the Labour Party,&nbsp;Peter Obi&nbsp;has expressed confidence that he can lead Nigeria without having the majority of lawmakers in the National Assembly.</p><p>This is coming after political activist,&nbsp;Reno Omokri warned that Obi&nbsp;might get impeached if he emerges president in 2023.</p><p>Omokri said Obi might not find it easy leading the country without the majority in the Senate.</p><p>Obi during an interview on News Central TV noted that he had no lawmaker in the House of Assembly while he was the Governor of Anambra State.</p><p>The presidential candidate said if lawmakers in the national assembly see that he is doing the right thing as president, they will align.</p><h2>That’s the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
