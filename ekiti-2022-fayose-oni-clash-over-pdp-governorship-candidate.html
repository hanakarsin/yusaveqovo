Those who had issues with the conduct of the primary had made presentations to the appeal panel. The panel has affirmed the result of the primary election.</p><p>“If anybody is saying another thing, he is on his own. The level now is that we wish and feel that everybody in the PDP including Engr Segun Oni will work together to ensure the victory of our candidate.</p><p>“Kolawole went to Oni’s house at Ifaki Ekiti on Thursday and was told that he was not at home. Our candidate has visited other aspirants; we are talking to our people so that all of us can come together and win this election for PDP and for the people of Ekiti State.</p><p>“But anybody saying any other thing outside that is on his own. We know those who have remained in PDP and those who have moved in and out of PDP. We know those who were among the people who rigged PDP out in 2018.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye5JqZp6jmam2bn6Pa2lmnpGuvLSxjKilomWToa60tIyorZ6qXaWxsXnGqK2eqp6kv7S0yKlknJmembalrdOeZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./prison-break-107-fleeing-inmates-return-out-of-1844-fugitives-prison-service.html><span>←</span><span>107 Fleeing Inmates Return Out Of 1,844 Fugitives Prison Service</span></a>
