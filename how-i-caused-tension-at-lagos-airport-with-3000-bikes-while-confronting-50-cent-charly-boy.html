So, I stormed the airport with almost 3000 bikes.</p><p>“On getting to the airport, I asked Eedris to tell me what happened and he said he was booked for a show alongside 50 Cent and he went to sit in the first class in the plane where the rapper was and his bouncers asked him to leave that the first class space wasn’t for Nigerian artists but he refused, then they beat him up.</p><p>“They also beat his bouncer who tried to rescue him from them. 50 Cent was aware of what happened. After Eedris narrated his ordeal, I asked where 50 Cent was and they pointed to an SUV. So I went into the SUV to confront him.</p><p>“Already, 50 Cent’s security team was seeing the tension around the airport with the bike men moving around. I was also very high that day. I said to 50 Cent, ‘You are the one beating my people in their own country?
