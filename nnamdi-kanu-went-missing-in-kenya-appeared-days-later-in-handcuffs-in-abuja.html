Appeared Days Later In Handcuffs In Abuja'</h1></header><section class=post-content><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Kanu1-600x375-2.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>A brother to the leader of the proscribed <a href=#>Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB)</a>, Nnamdi Kanu, has narrated how they lost contact with the IPOB leader after he went “missing.”</h2><p>Speaking to The UK Guardian, Kingsley Kanu stated that the pro-Biafra activist was abducted when he took a walk on the streets of Kenya.</p><p>Kanu’s brother, Kingsley, said he had spoken with him while he was in Kenya, “days before he went missing in June.”</p><p>“I spoke to him on the phone, he was well, in Nairobi. His associates said he went out, he didn’t take his documents with him; so he wasn’t planning on going anywhere. Then, all of a sudden, we see him paraded in handcuffs in Abuja,” Kingsley said.</p><p>“It is an extraordinary rendition, aided by Kenyan authorities. It is an outrage that cannot be allowed to happen.</p><p>“We are holding the Nigerian government and Kenyan government responsible. The British government, they know what is happening,” he said, adding that UK officials had made contact with Kanu’s family and legal team and that there were concerns he would be abused in detention.</p><p>“I am concerned for his wellbeing because you know how they will treat him,” the IPOB leader’s brother added.</p><p>According to The UK Guardian,&nbsp;evidence at its disposal shows that Kanu entered Kenya this year on his British passport on a visa expiring in June, adding “His UK passport remains in Kenya.”</p><p>Kanu was not in possession of a Nigerian passport, his family said, and he has verbally renounced Nigerian citizenship in broadcasts.</p><p>“The abduction of a person from a foreign country with the aim of rendition to justice is illegal under international law” the newspaper stated.</p><p>Recall that Nnamdi Kanu’s lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor had revealed that the IPOB leader told him how he was detained not in the Kenya official detention centers but in a private residence for about eight days, before his extradition to Nigeria.</p><p>The lawyer had said, “There was a clear collaboration between the Kenya government and the Nigerian government. I am happy that they now deny the fact that Kanu was arrested there.</p><p>“But by the time we finish with them at the International Criminal Court, they will never remain the same. He was arrested at the airport there, and he was taken to an unknown residence. He was subjected to inhuman treatment.</p><p>“Kanu was tortured, maltreated and mercilessly beaten, as confirmed by him to us. After spending eight days in their illegal custody, they now beckoned to the Nigerian government. Kanu was lifeless and unconscious by the time they were bringing him to Nigeria.</p><p>“To tell you the level of their conspiracy and the desperation to get him, they brought him here on a Sunday and the federal government is fully aware that I am his legal counsel.</p><p>“He was brought into the country and inflicted with several injuries and he is having many medical issues today. It was at the behest of the Federal government that Kenya was doing those things. This is against all international laws. We are going to address an international court at that level.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5BpZqemkaKxqnnKmqWuZaeau7V5zKKqrKGenHqquoyknKexkWKusbzEmqmenF2Zrrq%2FjKWYrZ2iYraveceapZ2bpZuztHnIp2SamqWfrnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./453020-senate-presidency-saraki-kick-against-apc-criteria-html.html><span>←</span><span>Senate Presidency: Saraki Dismisses APC Criteria</span></a>
