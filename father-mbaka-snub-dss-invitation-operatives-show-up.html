So as it is now, Fr Mbaka has not been served any letter of invitation from the DSS,” the source added.</p><p>Asked if Mbaka would go to the Abuja office of the DSS, he said, “No, he will not go to the DSS office. Father told me that he will not go to Abuja until they bring him an invitation.”</p><p>Also, reacting to the development, the Catholic Diocese of Enugu said it had yet to see the DSS letter summoning the priest.</p><p>The diocese Communications Director, Rev, Fr. Benjamin Achi, said, “The church will react if the DSS serves Fr. Mbaka the invitation letter or come to arrest him. He is our priest and it is our duty to protect him.</p><p>“He (Mbaka) waited yesterday (Monday), but he didn’t see anybody.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH13e49yZp%2BZpJ2ys3nMm5ikmV2ou7aujJ2qrGWZo8OqwMCtoKimXaS9pr7AraCvnaNiwKm71masqWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kat-von-d-children.html><span>←</span><span>Who Are Kat Von D's Children?
