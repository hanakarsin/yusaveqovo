Source: TikTok | @winta_zesuNavigating the dating world can often feel like you're wading through a cesspool of people who have tons of asks, needs, boxes they require to be ticked, expectations, and insincerity.
It's enough sometimes to make folks want to swear off on trying to meet new people altogether, especially if you're not a fan of going out on a date, to begin with as you sit across from someone who can't read a room and won't stop talking about all the wild stuff they did with their friends in college, or, if you're out to dinner with them and the expectation is that you're the one footing the bill, you watch them greedily try and milk that free dinner for all its worth.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jacob Sartorius - Age, Family, Bio</h2><time>Jul 2, 2024</time>
