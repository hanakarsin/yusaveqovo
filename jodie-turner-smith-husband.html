But one of the things fans look forward to is witnessing classic characters come back to finish or expand their storylines in the right way.</p><p>Sadly, that’s not the case with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jodie Turner-Smith’s</a> husband, actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua Jackson</a>, on the series <a href=#>The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers.</a> While many of the original Ducks came back, Charlie Conway (Jackson) was noticeably MIA for the reunion.&nbsp;</p><p>So, many fans are wondering what exactly is going on. Keep reading as we help you make sense of Joshua’s absence from The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers and share more about his relationship with Jodie.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Joshua is not featured on the latest episode of ‘The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers’ series because of his busy schedule.</h2><p>It’s always nice to see your favorite characters make a comeback on the big or small screen. But in the case of the latest episode of The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers, one character was missing: Charlie.</p><p>Many believe that the reason Charlie was not on the episode is because of a possible rift between his character and Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez), according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Wrap</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The outlet shared that the issue may be that Charlie has lost faith in Bombay’s abilities as a coach and decided not to attend the gala.&nbsp;</p><p>However, that's more than likely not the case. The site shares that in reality, Joshua is not included in the reunion because of his jam-packed schedule.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Charlie’s mom in Mighty Ducks was 30 when the movie came out so excuse me while I go die.</p>— Amy Deveau (@amydeveau) <a href=#>April 29, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>In fact, Steven Brill, the creator of The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers, shed some light on the situation. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Entertainment Weekly</u></a>, Steven said that Joshua “was too busy, just working." He also noted that the pandemic can take a toll on scheduling.</p><p>However, Steven did express that he would love to see Joshua come back. “I hope Josh makes a reappearance in the future, for sure,” he said.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Aside from their professional lives, Joshua and Jodie have been focused on having children.</h2><p>It goes without saying that both Joshua and Jodie have given many celebrity couples a run for their money in the relationship goals department. Not only are they talented, but you can tell they are truly enamored with one another.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>And their love and devotion to one another have blossomed into the couple expanding their family.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple announced that they were expecting a child after jumping the broom in December 2019, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>People</u></a>. And in April 2020, they welcomed their daughter Janie to the world.&nbsp;</p><p>While there is no telling if Joshua and Jodie will continue to expand their family, we wouldn't be surprised if they live as a family of three for awhile. After all, both actors are very busy with their careers.&nbsp;Most recently, Jodie stars in the movie <a href=#>Without Remorse</a>, which hits Amazon Prime on April 30, 2021.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jodie Turner-Smith (@jodiesmith)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Joshua has quite the sizable net worth to work with.</h2><p>Joshua is not new to the acting world.
