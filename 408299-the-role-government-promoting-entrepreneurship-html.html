Over the past few years, the government has introduced various schemes to boost the startup ecosystem and encourage entrepreneurship. However, most entrepreneurs are not aware of these initiatives, and they do not take advantage of such schemes</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/ffb61d1646fd2947.jpeg><p class=align-left>The success enjoyed by most countries can be attributed to the role played by technological entrepreneurship, which continues to drive their economies today. In response, the government has taken measures to promote and cultivate the entrepreneurial culture in the country. This explains why there has been significant growth in startups in recent times.</p><h2>Role of the government in promoting entrepreneurship</h2><p class=align-left>What is the role of government in entrepreneurship development? There are so many answers to the question of how governments encourage entrepreneurial growth. If you dream of becoming an entrepreneur, you should check out the government schemes to promote entrepreneurship listed below.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/8365390ff63d1457.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Worst businesses to start in Kenya: The top 10 list</span></p></a><h3>Grants, loans and disbursements</h3><p class=align-left>Money to start your business—could anything be better? That's what a grant or loan could do for your startup. Grants and loans are top on the list of government initiatives to promote entrepreneurship. The government gives loans and grants directly to entrepreneurs to help them build and grow their startups.</p><p class=align-left>Schemes such as grants and loans can help you keep your <a href=#>business</a> afloat in the short term. The best part about getting a grant is that the money is yours to keep, and you'll never have to pay it back after using it for your startup. If you are brave and willing to take the plunge and put yourself out there, a little help from the government in the form of a small business loan can go a long way.</p><h3>Friendly trade policies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/8365390ff63d1457.jpeg><p class=align-left>The government formulates and implements policies intended to promote entrepreneurship in the country. It lowers or eliminates tariffs and quotas to encourage foreign trade. The relaxed trade restrictions and free trade zones allow startups to save on costs, increase profit margins and expand in the long term.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d5c1a12f1d25436d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to get angel investors in Kenya</span></p></a><h3>Tax incentives</h3><p class=align-left>If you think about the role of government in providing relief and help to entrepreneurs, the first thing that comes to your mind is tax incentives. Governments constantly review and alter their tax policies to promote the growth of small businesses. Lower corporate income taxes can be a great factor in the promotion of the growth of small businesses.</p><h3>Automated registration of businesses</h3><p class=align-left>Initially, it wasn't easy to register a business, and it would require one to visit different government agencies and put together many documents to register their business. The process took too long, and sometimes, it discouraged the entrepreneurs from registering their startups.</p><p class=align-left>In the current digital age, entrepreneurs do not need to queue at the government offices to register their startups. The government then introduced automatic business registration. Entrepreneurs can register their startups online from the comfort of their home, pay the necessary fees using mobile money, and print the documents.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/1b0e1fa58879f719.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to win government tenders in Kenya</span></p></a><h3>Providing a fair legal system</h3><p class=align-left>You cannot talk about the role of government in business without mentioning the legal system. If you imagine doing business without any legal means to protect your best interests, you'll understand why the rule of law is essential to business.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/c92717a7bd19be38.jpeg><p class=align-left>Without <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">predictable rules and patterns </a>to adhere to, doing business would be chaotic. It would be difficult to predict how the other party would act in a given situation, and it would be all too easy for an entrepreneur to be taken advantage of. The rule of law provides much-needed consistency, stability, and certainty in a potentially volatile business environment.</p><h3>Adequate security systems</h3><p class=align-left>The government ensures that there is proper <a href=#>security</a> for entrepreneur's businesses. It provides sound security systems to encourage its citizens and other investors to do business in the country.</p><p class=align-left>With an adequate security system in place, entrepreneurs can grow and expand their businesses without fear of being attacked or their businesses being robbed. This will also attract foreign investors as most of them fear investing in insecure places.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/8aef8f704a06aea7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>KPA internship 2019: Minimum qualifications and the deadline for applying for the top fields</span></p></a><h3>Provision of training opportunities</h3><p class=align-left>The government also supports entrepreneurship through the provision of training opportunities. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Entrepreneurship training </a>is a structured program that aims to equip participants with the necessary skillset and mindset for identifying and launching new business ventures.</p><p class=align-left>Various government institutions offer training on entrepreneurship skills. The government has also partnered with private training institutions in the country to provide entrepreneurial training to entrepreneurs.</p><h3>Establishment of small businesses offices</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d5c1a12f1d25436d.jpeg><p class=align-left>The establishment of small business offices is another tool at the disposal of the government to promote entrepreneurship. The government set up offices or departments at the sub-county, county, and national levels where potential entrepreneurs are guided on the financing options, networking, and so on. Entrepreneurs get free advice on how to improve and grow their startups.</p><p class=align-left>Now you understand the role of government in promoting entrepreneurship. As you have seen, the government is putting extra effort into promoting entrepreneurship to drive the economy. If you are planning to start a business in the country, you should take advantage of the government schemes to promote entrepreneurship.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/46c4c8591381473f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Comprehensive guide about tax exemption in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke </a>published an article on the top 10 <a href=#>sources of business ideas </a>& opportunities for entrepreneurs.
