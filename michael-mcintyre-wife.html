Per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, Michael had this to say about his beautiful bride in his 2010 book, Life and Laughing. He said, "She was the girl I had been looking for.

According to the same report from The Sun, a bit about Michael's wife trying to put tights on is always a hit with his standup audiences.
