Unfortunately for the terrorists, they ended up torching a private, Korean-owned English academy.</p><p>"We were so relieved to find out later that the academy just used the name American Center," said a police officer at the Suseong Police Precinct.</p><p>The fired burned parts of the school’s front door, walls and floors. Firefighters arrived at the scene quickly and put the fire out. No casualties were reported.&nbsp;</p><p>At the site, five flyers decrying the United States were found along with shattered fluorescent lights and the glass from the Molotov cocktails.&nbsp;</p><p>The flyers bore the name of the Anti-American Fascism Struggle Committee and read,</p><p>"The U.S. has committed inhumane and unpardonable atrocities against the Korean people for over 100 years and is now attempting to wage a nuclear war on this land.&nbsp;No single American will leave this country alive if Washington wages another war here."</p><p>The police reported there is no such committee registered.&nbsp;CCTV cameras caught images of two masked suspects in their late 20s entering the building at 6:39 a.m. yesterday with backpacks.</p><p>Armed soldiers from the 50th Division of the Korean Army were dispatched to stand guard in front of the building yesterday.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHN8lmtloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./307846-mass-failure-at-nigerian-law-school-html.html><span>←</span><span>Mass Failure At Nigerian Law School</span></a>
