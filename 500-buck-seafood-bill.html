In the comments section of the now viral TikTok post, Damienne said "I swear we could've got a house full of groceries."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @damienneflagler</span></figure><p>She also remarked that she asked the restaurant if she could go in the back to do some dishes in order to help settle the bill. "Y‚Äôall got to try this place. But I got to keep it 100% with y‚Äôall. This is not a cheap date. My big a-- ordering all of this food, and I didn‚Äôt even realize the king crab alone [was] $200! What!?"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @damienneflagler</span></figure><p>In the caption of the video she quipped, "Your belly gone be full but your pockets gone be empty."</p><p>Commenters were shocked at just how much food she ordered. "How the hell do you even eat all that in one sitting???" one commenter wrote.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @damienneflagler</span></figure><p>Others were puzzled by the fact that she wasn't aware of how much money she was spending the entire time or that she didn't inquire about prices or look at the menu. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Online, The Boiler</a> lists its prices in slightly larger font sizes than the item descriptions. There are a wide variety of entree options too that start at $18, in addition to the higher priced boil bag menu items/combos.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @damienneflagler</span></figure><p>And then there were others who were flabbergasted at the pricing of some of the items, like $10 for a ramen and other accouterments addition, along with $200 for fried King Crab legs.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @damienneflagler</span></figure><p>What do you think? Have you ever just ordered a bunch of stuff off the menu and were shocked by the bill?
