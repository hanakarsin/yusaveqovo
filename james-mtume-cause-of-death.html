His passing was confirmed to the world by Lisa Lucas, daughter of James' late close friend/creative partner Reggie Lucas. She also took to Twitter on the day that he died to share her thoughts about his life and the immense void that the loss of the legendary producer leaves in many people's hearts.</p><p>"So much loss. So much grief. Rest in power to Uncle Mtume. My late father's partner in crime, the co-creator of the songs of my life (and about my birth!). He was an essential part of the life of the man who made me, therefore me too. Gone now. He will be dearly, eternally missed," she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in her touching tribute.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I hope the city of Philadelphia does something special for James Mtume and Bob Saget.
