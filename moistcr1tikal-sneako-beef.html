For the most part, it unfolds in real time too.</p><p>One major example comes from streamers <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MoistCr1TiKal</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sneako</a>. The two of them have been engaged in an ongoing feud for several months, and every time they interact, the conflict escalates.

He is best known for reaction videos on games and other aspects of pop culture, delivering deadpan comedic commentary in a deep monotone voice. He currently has over 12.5 million subscribers on his YouTube channel, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">penguinz0,</a> and continues to post and stream regularly.</p><p>And in the other corner, there's Nico Kenn De Balinthazy — aka Sneako. Having debuted in 2013, this YouTuber is popular for his gaming streams and motivational videos. During the COVID-19 pandemic, however, he generated controversy and backlash for consistently making sexist remarks and publicly spouting hateful and antisemitic rhetoric. He has even associated with other controversial right-wing figureheads like <a href=#>Andrew Tate</a> and Donald Trump.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The feud between MoistCr1TiKal and Sneako has become so intense that it already has its own entry on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Know Your Meme</a>. According to the site, Sneako criticized MoistCr1TiKal for making comments about one of his friends, influencer FreshPrinceCeo. Sneako would throw around his own hate targeting both Cr1TiKal and his girlfriend.</p><p>In late November 2022, MoistCr1TiKal responded, calling Sneako out for his own salacious behavior with his own girlfriend.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Got your discord still working on responses? Brother I have no problem, you started it and I made fun of you in return. You're upset about publicly admitting to cuckoldry and get mad at me for bringing it up. You should be mad at yourself instead, have some self reflection <a href=#>https://t.co/JLwWbp1iCX</a></p>— Charlie (@MoistCr1TiKaL) <a href=#>March 13, 2023</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In the months following, MoistCr1TiKal and Sneako took their feud to Twitter as they each lobbied criticisms and threats of violence at each other. Sneako took it a step further by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">calling out</a> other content creators who criticize his actions.</p><p>In one of his streams on Rumble, Sneako even pulled out a gun and threatened to use it on Cr1TiKal if he continued calling him out.</p><p>"You want me to watch your clips? Watch my clips," Sneako exclaimed in one stream while holding up two firearm magazines to his camera.</p><p>MoistCr1TiKal continues to escalate the feud as well. On March 14, the streamer posted a video entitled "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sneako Is Horrible</a>," in which he directly addresses Sneako's threats. Cr1TiKal even pulls out two sizable firearms of his own, correcting Sneako on his use of the word "clips" while also brandishing his arsenal at the same time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforyqv9OcqWqsmaCurXnSp5yao59ir6axxQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./liam-mcdermott-html.html><span>←</span><span>Liam Aaron McDermott - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
