Judging by locals’ accounts of the training, this was where Boko Haram militants gained skills to allow them to expand beyond their typical quick-hit bomb strikes.</p><p>On dunes just west of the customs house, Boko Haram fighters fired shoulder-fired arms, the cook and four neighbors said — though it couldn’t be determined if they were describing sophisticated rockets or more rudimentary mortars. In its Nigeria attacks, Boko Haram appears not to have used shoulder-mounted weapons.</p><p>Within a week of the foreign militants’ arrival, the al Qaeda-backed groups began offering jobs to locals. A gunman came to the cook’s door, looking for someone fluent in the Hausa language — which the cook had learned in Kumasi, a trading town in Ghana with a large Hausa population. They paid him about N3,000 a day, he said, to cook for Ansar Dine and Boko Haram.</p><p>A restaurateur said he sometimes brought tubs of couscous and spaghetti to the training camp, but said the Boko Haram fighters didn’t extend much courtesy to locals. "They are extremely rude," said the restaurateur, adding: "They pay whatever price you want."</p><p>On a typical day, after rising before dawn to pray and read the Quran, the militants ran five laps around the sand-choked lot, the size of several football fields, said the cook and neighbors who witnessed the exercises. After push-ups in the sand, the militants ate a breakfast of bread and powdered milk.</p><p>They then met with specialists, the cook said. He described an arms specialist from Pakistan, who he said taught Boko Haram and Ansar Dine members how to break apart and reassemble assault rifles, over and over again. There was a computer specialist who appeared, to the cook, to be mostly occupied making fliers extolling the fundamentalist cause. A heavy arms specialist who the cook said was from</p><p>Afghanistan told militants how to breathe steadily when firing a shoulder-mounted rocket.</p><p>"Swear to God, every day, new people, they come," said Moulhar Arby, a girl in the earthen-wall house next door to the customs office. "Nobody knows how they come here."</p><p>Commanders from Boko Haram and Ansar Dine gave newcomers 4,000 West African CFA, the local equivalent of N1,250, to enlist, the cook said. After training, he said, recruits were given about N4,700—their first taste of money following months of sharing bathrooms with scores of militants.</p><p>Days before the French bomb hollowed out the customs building, the Nigerians sneaked away, neighbors said. Every night, a few came back to toggle the lights, these people said, presumably to convey to surveillance planes above that Boko Haram was still in Timbuktu, the report said.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkf3ODlm5loaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./killumantii-html.html><span>←</span><span>Killumantii - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
