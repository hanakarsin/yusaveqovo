The Laundrie family did not speak with North Port police about Gabby's disappearance. However, Christopher and Roberta reported to authorities that Brian was missing on Sept. 17.</p><p>Charlene and William Guthrie are neighbors of the Laundries. William Guthrie told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a> that they had witnessed Brian and his parents prepping for a trip a week after Brian returned without Gabby. "I saw them doing some work," he said. "And then when they prepared for their trip, I saw them loading the camper." After the Laundries departed that weekend in their camper, the Guthries were then notified by authorities that Gabby was missing.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Brian's parents then reported him missing days after the Laundries returned from their weekend outing with the camper.</p><p>Brian Laundrie's whereabouts have been the subject of a nationwide manhunt ever since Petito's body was found at the Spread Creek Dispersed Camping area in Jackson, Wyo. An initial <a href=#>autopsy report</a> ruled that the manner of Petito's death was a homicide, though the official cause of death is still pending. Investigators are still searching for Brian Laundrie. Although he has not yet been named a suspect in Petito's murder, a <a href=#>warrant for Brian Laundrie's arrest</a> was issued last night for bank fraud.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Brian Laundrie (@bizarre_design_)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Many followers of Petito's case have been frustrated by Brian Laundrie's parents' silence on their son's location. Many have questioned how the police could allow their son to get away after returning to Florida without Petito, with the general consensus being that his parents potentially helped their son escape, possibly in the camper. While the search for Brian Laundrie is ongoing, some people have found a way to strike at the Laundrie parents via their privately-owned service company for commercial juicers<strong>.</strong></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Brian Laundrie's parents business has been review-bombed online.</h2><p>Christopher and Roberta Laundrie's company is called Juicer Services Inc. There is currently only one five-star Google review for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicer Services Inc</a>. online, while more recent feedback for the company has been positively scathing:</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bizapedia</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bizapedia</span></figure><p>It is worth noting that the link for the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicer Services Inc.</a> website no longer works and that Juicer Services Inc. is listed as temporarily closed on Google at this time. Gabby herself stated in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bodycam video</a> from that now-infamous police stop in Moab, Utah on Aug. 12 that she used to work at a juice bar. However, the juice bar Gabby worked at doesn't appear to have any connection to the Laundrie parents' business.</p><p>While it has yet to be officially confirmed whether or not Brian Laundrie's parents helped their son escape, public sentiment against the entire family is overwhelmingly negative. Victim advocate and television host <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Walsh dubbed the family the "Dirty Laundries</a>," and echoed the belief that Brian's parents may have helped him evade authorities.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2Bqrc1mo5qtnpm%2FqrGMqZirnZ6pwG6vwKannqo%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10th-nass-tinubu-angry-with-adamu-may-shift-lawmakers-inauguration-source.html><span>←</span><span>10th NASS: 'Tinubu Angry With Adamu, May Shift Lawmakers Inauguration'</span></a>
