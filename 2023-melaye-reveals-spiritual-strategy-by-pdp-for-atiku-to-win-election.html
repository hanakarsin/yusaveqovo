When we ask ‘God’, He now answers our prayers. God willing, Who says be and becomes, we have made up our mind, all of us.”</p><h2>Kaduna Has Always Supported Us</h2><p>Speaking further, Melaye pointed out that Kaduna State has always been a strong PDP party and expressed optimism that the results will show this in 2023.</p><p>He said his party can boast of many past Governors and other dignitaries including a former Vice President in Kaduna State but the All Progressives Congress (APC) can’t boast of the same.</p><p>He submitted, “I want to say something. There is no way APC is going to campaign in Kaduna State and present to you one former governor of Kaduna State among them. We have three former governors of Kaduna State here. There is former Vice President Namadi, Governor Makarfi, and Governor Ramalan Yero. Clap for them. And the incoming governor in 2023 is here, too.</p><p>“In terms of election in Kaduna this time, we have the upper hand. Yesterday I was saying that Kaduna people should do what they did in the past and my elder brother, Senator Ningi, said he is in the best position to tell me the position of the people of Kaduna State. He said the people have vowed (to vote PDP).”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BxZmtoYmh6rrHLmrCeZaKaw6aty6xkrKiZp7a1wcClZKysopbBprPYZpmyZaCZvW6yzqtkmqyZoMJuwM5mrqKmXZq5pq%2FToqanZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-old-enough-real.html><span>←</span><span>Is 'Old Enough!'
