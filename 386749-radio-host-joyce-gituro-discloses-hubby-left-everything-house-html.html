I lost my husband in church. My husband told me we had to leave the church where we used to worship and he took to a church that I did not believe in. When I went there I told my husband I am not comfortable with the doctrines...The church was sounding funny," she narrated.<p class=align-left>The mother of three recounted a day they were asked to close the door and the windows of the new church to cast out the devil.</p>"I remember one day the pastor said we close the windows and doors so that we chase out the devil. I told my husband I am not very comfortable and went out with my kids. When I walked out the pastor did not like it and that is where the problems with my hubby began... When I talked to my hubby, he reprimanded me that walking out was wrong," she added.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/ca73f366058be130.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ugandan woman says lover secretly married another lady when she was 7 months pregnant</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The Radio Jambo presenter said her hubby left them and carried everything from their house.</p>"My hubby left us. He carried everything in the house. I have never seen a man who when leaving packs the cooker, fridge, seats, curtains and other things in the house. I was shocked. We had our own issues but I did not expect it to get to that," said the religious woman.<p class=align-left>Gituro said she started seeing some weird behaviors in her hubby who would always receive scary prophecies from the pastor.</p><p class=align-left>She recalled one day he took a lot of money to buy a TV for the pastor at a time they had not paid their children's school fees.</p>"I called my parents-in-law. I told them that their son had joined a cult. He would disappear saying he has gone for prayers.

He got into debts to an extent that even my car was taken away," she said.<p class=align-left>The mother of three said that one day she was followed by the police with the claims that her car had been stolen.</p>"I was followed by police all the way to Royal Media. The police asked me if the car was mine and I told them yes. They told me that the car had been stolen. I was confused because I had given my hubby money to buy me the car. I later realised that he did not buy me a car but hired one and brought it to me. It was a stolen car," she added<p class=align-left>In a related story, media personality Margaret Wariko revealed what led to her divorce at such a young age.</p><p class=align-left>In an interview with Monica Kagoni, Wariko disclosed she said 'I Do' to her college sweetheart at the age of 23.</p><p class=align-left>According to the beautiful mom of one, she was a reserved person and on completion of her diploma, she felt that she was ready to be a wife.</p><p class=align-left>Wariko disclosed that at the time of marriage, she and her lover had already secured themselves jobs and were ready to soldier on.</p>"I got married at 23.
