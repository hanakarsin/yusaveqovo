And with more than 60 to choose from across the map, they shouldn‚Äôt be difficult to complete. Here‚Äôs a quick look at three quests this season that task you with finding a campfire (along with their rewards).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Shoutout to this random Vegeta who ran towards me from across the lobby, bowed and then invited me to a cozy campfire.</p><p>This is why I love Fortnite ü§£<a href=#>#Fortnite</a> <a href=#>#FortniteWILDS</a> <a href=#>#OptimusPrime</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4wHAd1HRnS</a></p>‚Äî Fuoca üî•‚öîÔ∏è Vtuber (@FuocaTTV) <a href=#>July 5, 2023</a></figure><ul><li>Light a campfire ‚Äî 30,000 XP</li><li>Emote by a lit campfire ‚Äî Treezy Back Bling</li><li>Light campfires in three different matches ‚Äî 30,000 XP</li></ul><p>That last one is the most challenging, as you‚Äôll need to play multiple rounds to complete the quest. Lighting a single campfire during a match will count toward your quota, and once you‚Äôve done that in three matches, you‚Äôll be rewarded with 30,000 XP.</p><p>Campfires are bound to be popular in Fortnite right now due to these quests, so pay close attention to your surroundings when venturing out to find one. When you do find one, light it quickly before someone else creeps up on you. The safest campfires are the ones located near dense foliage, which provides plenty of cover and keeps you away from prying eyes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6uvMWiqZ5lnKSwosDIqKWsZZakv7W6yK2c</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./breaking-why-senate-rejected-lauretta-onochie-as-inec-commissioner.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Why Senate Rejected Lauretta Onochie As INEC Commissioner</span></a>
