Luckily, the musician has some dedicated fans who’ve done the work to figure out what each of his tattoos means, so we’re here to explain all of them.</p><p>Twitter user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@102SWIFT</a> led the way to understanding a bit more about the enigmatic singer-songwriter.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">"True Love Annie" tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>true love annie // this tattoo is dedicated to mattys grandmother and he has stated that this is his favourite tattoo 🫶 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/MCDqligTer</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>One of Matty's biggest tattoos in the center of his chest says "true love Annie" and honors his late grandmother. He spoke about it with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shazam Top 20</a> in 2015: "My favorite tattoos are the ones for my nana on my chest ... My nana hated all my tattoos. She made me promise I would never get a tattoo of her when she died and about 16 hours after she died I got a tattoo of her on my chest."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">"We Are Kings" tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>we are kings // related to the lyrics of his song Wolves under Drive Like I Do <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bfCZvlnICK</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>Before The 1975 chose their band name, they were called Drive Like I Do. Their song "Wolves" incorporated the lyrics "We are kings," which is about how they're not afraid to start a war to get to the top.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Deer tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>deer // (robbers mv 😔) deers symbolise motherly love and connection with nature 🫶 possibly this tattoo is dedicated to his parents <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/DvSHtQwP9T</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>While Alexa here guesses that the deer tattoo could be dedicated to Matty's parents, deer are also a symbol of "spiritual authority," according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Faena</a>. Matty is atheist, but he likely has a spiritual side to him as well, and because the deer's antlers fall off and regenerate, this could be a symbol of Matty's "rebirth" after his struggles with addiction.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Allerton tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>allerton // this tattoo is a reference to mattys favourite book ‘Queer’ by William S. Burroughs <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/GyKwWqyZ6Q</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>Matty added in 2015 that Allerton in a heart is his other favorite tattoo. It's a reference to his favorite book, Queer by William S. Burroughs, who is one of Matty's heroes.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">"Weak messages create bad situations" tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>wmcbs // i feel like this tattoo really shows who matty is and what he believes 😌 (even if others disagree) also dedicated/based off a David Shrigley cartoon <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FMX1RZ23d5</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>This tattoo is based on David Shrigley's book Weak Messages Create Bad Situations: A Manifesto. "Lots of individuals in society today are feeble-minded. They don’t know what the HELL is going on," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David wrote on his website</a>. "Unfortunately many of these people are responsible for running THE COUNTRY. They don’t know the difference between a PRECIOUS JEWEL and a piece of animal turd. Their ideas are MEANINGLESS, illustrated using RUBBISH imagery (often made by a computer). The stupid words they write are always in BAD FONTS."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Anchor tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>anchor ⚓️ // this tattoo usually alludes to being held down and grounded however matty hasnt ever spoken of this tattoo so we dont know what it means to him <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/dFkuHV4FXA</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>Anchors typically represent grounding or stability, or just a love for the nautical sides of life. We're not sure what it means exactly for Matty but it could be anything.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">"DAD" tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>DAD // (future dilf incoming wbk 😍) jk kidding we love you tim healy <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/yo6vIv6rXp</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>Matty isn't a dad himself, so this is clearly honoring his own father, Tim Healy.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">"Newcastle United" tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Newcastle United // guess he really likes football 🤷‍♀️ (ive never seen this man ever mention it 💀) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Y2Rts12dkU</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>Matty is famously a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Newcastle United</a> fan, supporting English football (i.e., soccer), so this tattoo signifies his love for the football club, despite being born in London and raised in Cheshire, near Manchester. He did spend many early years on a farm in Hedley on the Hill, which is close to Newcastle upon Tyne.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Mortal Kombat tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>mortal kombat // anyways… gamer nerd <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/kWpSxPBSR3</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>Matty has a tattoo of a dragon in a circle, which is the symbol for Mortal Kombat. Yes, Matty is a gamer, and he's so dedicated to gaming that he even got a tattoo to signify it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">2023 cross tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>✝️ // matty’s most recent tattoo is from Godspeed You! Black Emperor’s album F#A#♾️ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/KGP6GFOezR</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>Matty's not religious, so this tattoo of a cross is a reference to the album F♯ A♯ ∞, by the rock band Godspeed You! Black Emperor.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">1975 tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>the 1975 // “when they were deciding the name of the band someone told matty he couldn’t name the band a number so he tattooed it on his arm so they had to” 😌 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/LiqQuvpgnm</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>This one should be obvious, but Matty actually got it when critics said a band name can't be a number so they would be forced to name themselves a number. Clearly it paid off.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">"Love" tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>love // 🥰 really shows what a kind-hearted person he is 🫶 ily matty <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/9V84N2bMyc</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>What does "love" mean? Well, that's a bigger societal question. But Matty loves love, and so do we.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">"Timothy" and "Denise" tattoos</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>timothy & denise // it is very obvious that matty feels a really strong sense of love and devotion to his parents 😌 which is the basis of these tattoos <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YLYqcUDIBP</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>Who are Timothy and Denise? Matty's parents! Even if they don't support his tattoo addiction, at least he honored them with tattoos of their own (albeit on his feet).</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Cross tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>cross // as we know matty has very publicly expressed that he is an atheist so obviously this symbol conflicts with that belief but we dont actually know why matty got this tattoo and perhaps it has an entirely different meaning to him 🫶 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/wEYmS1FwV1</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>Even though Matty is an atheist, he has two crosses tattooed on his body. Both of Matty's parents were working actors and he was raised without religion, so the cross likely isn't a religious reference. It could have just been done by an artist Matty loves and respects who specializes in cross art.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">The Box tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>the box // 😍 its so special that thousands of fans share a tattoo with the guys (me included 😌 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vk3llLUoTq</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>The Box from The 1975 is basically a representation of the band's logo and aesthetic. It's seen on several of the band's albums and is considered the trademark tattoo for The 1975 fans as well.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Rose tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>rose // little floral boy 🥺🥺 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/X9K8A5zPMs</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>Matty Healy and the band often adopt a floral aesthetic in their merch, so Matt's tattooed rose could simply be that. There's also a six-pointed star as part of the tattoo, which could tie to the Star of David. Matty isn't Jewish at all, but that also signifies a tribal state of mind, ties to a spiritual homeland, and rooting for the underdog (David vs. Goliath).</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Girl tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>girl // matty has a portrait of a girl on his shin 🤷‍♀️ who is she matty??? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/P3lnCWPXO3</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>Matty has a tattoo of a girl on his shin, which could mean something or nothing. In the same Shazam Top 20 interview, Matty revealed that when a tattoo shop opened down the street, he and his friends let the tattoo artists practice on their legs. From the looks of this tattoo, it does look like an older tattoo, so it could just be one of his meaningless leg tats.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">"I'm a Man" tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>im a man // i think this was a very impulsive tattoo matty (so me) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/AUU6y2H6YX</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>Matty has a tattoo that simply says, "I'm a man." According to fans, he actually got the tattoo onstage during a concert in Newport, R.I., when a fan also got the classic box tattoo onstage.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Wabi Sabi tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>wabi sabi // “It’s a Japanese aesthetic paradigm about the impermanence of beauty.” - Matty <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ED9llASfNT</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>Of course Matty has a gum tattoo. These tend to wear away over time, but Matty told Fader, "It’s a Japanese aesthetic paradigm about the impermanence of beauty.” Considering his experience with karate and his black belt, it makes sense that he has strong ties to Japanese culture.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">"I have killed him for you" poem tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>poem // "I have killed him for you and I have brought him to you as a reminder of our own inevitable slip into the great nothing" quote from Mature Themes by Andrew Durbin <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/g1zEcXmB7n</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>The poem on Matty's stomach is a quote from Andrew Durbin's Mature Themes, which is a hybrid text incorporating poetry, art criticism, and memoir. It's all about "disingenuity," which fits into Matty's efforts to be authentic and, at the same time, emit the image he desires. Plus, the form of the book matches The 1975's use of mixed-media.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">"SK9" tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>SK9 // this tattoo is the postcode for Wilmslow the area where matty grew up and went to high school and where he met the guys 🫶 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/5YRyUgOffb</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>Unlike in the United States, United Kingdom postal codes incorporate letters and numbers. "SK9" signifies the postal code for Wimslow, which is where Matty grew up, went to high school, and met his bandmates.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Number on his wrist tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>number // matty has stated that this is his passport number💀because his tour manager is always carrying his passport (blurred for privacy obvi) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/JWNEkFSfpk</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>Matty has actually spoken about this tattoo and said that it's his passport number because he doesn't have his passport on him. Of course, putting the number on his wrist as a public figure isn't the most secure option, but at this point, he's probably too famous to get his identity stolen.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Louis ship tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>louis ship // this tattoo is dedicated to his brother louis 🫶 ship tattoos usually represent home and direction <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/echnfC4bYV</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>Matty is really close to his brother, Louis, so this tattoo is in honor of him. While ships typically represent home and direction, there could be another meaning between the brothers that we're not aware of.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Unknown tattoo</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>i have no idea what this tattoo is im sorry i cannot find any more images 😭 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/LbUTXdgHEe</a></p>— alexa ⎕ MELB N2 (@1O2SWIFT) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>Even Alexa, who is arguably The 1975's biggest fan based on her Twitter thread, doesn't know what this tattoo is or what it means. Perhaps as Matty's fame grows, we'll learn more about the unknown tattoos covering his body.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq61wNhmn56ZnK56ta3Traaoq12axbG4wKKlnpw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leeexlieee-html.html><span>←</span><span>Les Do Makeup - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
