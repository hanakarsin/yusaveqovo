And if something were to happen to any one of them, let’s just say we’d be beside ourselves.</p><p>Although Oliver overcame the medical emergency in Episode 2, we watched him collapse again after Loretta (<a href=#>Meryl Streep</a>) was taken into custody for Ben's murder (although she may be innocent). So, what happened to Oliver?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happens to Oliver in ‘Only Murders in the Building’?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Hulu</span></figure><p>From the start, Oliver has become a favorite of mine (and, well, many). The struggling theater director’s exaggerated take on life and constant rollercoaster of emotions keeps us on our toes waiting to see what he’ll bring next. But, it seems as though Oliver’s “need to succeed” attitude is on the verge of taking him six feet under.</p><p>Oliver suffers a minor heart attack at the beginning of Season 3 of Only Murders in the Building, and he can thank his stressful career and poor eating habits for that (we all know he’s a fan of the dips). Oliver found himself lying across the steps of the cathedral where Ben’s funeral was held after <a href=#>Maxine</a>, a well-known theater critic, blatantly rejected his play, Death Rattle.</p><p>Fearing his career as a theater director might be nearing its end, Oliver induces a high level of stress upon himself and only fuels the fire by recollecting back to one of his last conversations with Ben (<a href=#>Paul Rudd</a>). As Ben reads through his lines describing the sound of a beating heart, Oliver is tightly grasping his chest, hoping to find relief from the pain his heart is causing him.</p><p>While we're grateful Oliver was able to overcome the minor heart attack, watching Loretta being escorted away by police after confessing his love for her didn't help. It seems Oliver may have suffered a more serious heart attack in Season 3, Episode 8.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Oliver Putnam die in 'Only Murders in the Building'?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Hulu</span></figure><p>We don't know if Oliver survives the second medical emergency in Episode 8. But, after nearly dying within the same walls that temporarily housed Ben’s body, Oliver overcame the minor heart attack. As serious as the condition might be, Oliver attempted to shrug it off by calling it “a right of passage in the theater.”</p><p>Although Oliver’s son Will (Ryan Broussard) is worried about his father’s condition, Oliver attempts to lighten the mood (typical parent move) by pointing out that Bob Fosse had five heart attacks (even though the last one killed him).</p><p>Of course, Oliver’s doctor quickly chimed in that he might not be so lucky the next time if he doesn’t start implementing major changes in his daily life habits. Some of those include modifying his diet (yes, that means cutting out the dips), monitoring his heartbeat with a doctor-issued monitor, and avoiding stress.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This episode will be chaotic and i am here for it <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QiXeJfGhJF</a></p>— PokeSturdy (@Sturdy_yt) <a href=#>July 27, 2023</a></figure><p>While we’re hopeful Oliver will stick around through the entire third season, he doesn’t appear to be taking his condition as seriously as he should. After all, he adapts his play into a musical despite his doctor’s recommendation to steer clear of stressful activities and falls in love with a potential murderer.</p><p>Catch new episodes of Only Murders in the Building Season 3 every Tuesday at 12 a.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaPAbsDOZqaloaaav267zaWwZqWlp7GmvtJmoKdlpJ2ybq7UoqOdoZ6c</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2023-the-south-will-square-up-with-the-north-to-produce-the-next-nigerian-president-akande.html><span>←</span><span>2023: The South Will Square Up With The North To Produce The Next Nigerian President</span></a>
