We've all seen them: the people who've been going to the gym for years, but just don't seem to get in any better shape. Hell, I feel like I'm one of them. I personally blame my lack of consistent control when it comes to dieting, which reduces my workouts to slowing down whatever long-term damage I'm doing to my body with Sour Patch Kids, chocolate, and Tostitos Lime Chips."><meta name=author content="Chauncey Koziol"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Hell, I feel like I'm one of them. I personally blame my lack of consistent control when it comes to dieting, which reduces my workouts to slowing down whatever long-term damage I'm doing to my body with Sour Patch Kids, chocolate, and Tostitos Lime Chips. My god, are they delicious.</p><p>And as unsatisfied as I am with my body because it's not like Zac Efron's in Baywatch, I can at least console myself with the fact that I don't go to the gym and go through the motions with the exercises like some people who casually go about their workouts without so much as breaking a sweat.</p><p>Now, I know I'm coming off as a judgey McJudgerson and like a total arrogant gym douche, but I'm being serious: I think people's time could be way better spent than wasting it at the gym if you're doing it like that. I hate going to the gym (but feel great after a workout) so if I was going there to just phone it in, I'd just give up and sit at home on the couch and binge-watch the years of shows I've been meaning to catch up on.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Which is why, for the life of me, I can't understand this ridiculous new 'Napercise' class being offered by a UK gym franchise.</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>The class involves 15 minutes of stretching, along with 45 minutes of uninterrupted sleep. You're given an eye mask, an inflatable mattress, and you sit in a room with strangers and sleep for a while.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">David Lloyd fitness clubs are advertising the new class as a means to "reinvigorate the mind, improve moods, and even burn the odd calorie."</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>View post on imgur.com</a></figure><p>It's hard to imagine though that a bit of stretching and 45 minutes of sleep is really going to help you attain your fitness goals. Unless your fitness goal is squeezing in enough sleep during the day. Then by all means, yeah, get to napping.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The class could be ideal for parents who need some peace and quiet away from their kids to recharge their batteries, so to speak.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>View post on imgur.com</a></figure><p>As a father myself, I know how tiring it can be to deal with a colicky baby or toddler who's been throwing tantrums all day. And as much as I want to knock this class, it is true that people who manage to squeeze in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">45-minute to an hour nap in the middle of the day tend to deal with stress better than those who don't. </a>Also, napping in the afternoon can help to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">boost your brain's capacity to learn. So there's that.</a></p><p>The class is going on a trial run in one location first and if it's popular, Napercise will be offered in more David Lloyd clubs throughout the UK. Think your gym should adopt this new sedentary group fitness routine?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKyimrultc2gZmtoYWx8cYCOa29okpeOl3WBjqeYqZ2imLa0sYypmKudnqnAbrPRqKypZZOhrrS%2F</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./angus-mclaren-html.html><span>←</span><span>Angus McLaren - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
