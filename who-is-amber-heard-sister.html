Born on Sept. 18, 1987, in Austin, Texas, Whitney is Amber's slightly younger sister. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>, she has one acting credit to her name.</p><p>A peek over at Whitney's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> reveals that she is the mother of two children: a girl named Hunter Wylde and a boy named Harlin Willow. Her page is filled with loving images of her with the two children as well as her husband, Gavin Henriquez. Gavin's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> account is private, but his avi shows a cute photo of him and Whitney together.</p><p>When she isn't sharing pictures of her family, Whitney promotes brand deals and documents her travels on the platform.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Whitney previously spoke out against Amber and Johnny's marriage.</h2><p>According to a 2020 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Whitney told the publication that she "begged" Amber to not marry Johnny.</p><p>"I told her it was a bad idea, begged her not to go through with it, and said that she should end it because it wasn’t going to get better," Whitney said at the time.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by whit heard (@whitheard)</a></p></figure><p>The actress's sister went on to make more damning claims about Johnny, saying, "I asked her, 'Why are you putting up with this?' and told her that him putting a ring on her finger was not going to stop him hitting her."</p><p>For context, Whitney's statements came out while Johnny's libel action against the publisher of The Sun was still going on in England.</p><p>As for his demeanor at the time, Whitney said that Johnny "was incredibly jealous and possessive and was threatened by her former partners and co-stars, both men and women." Although she hasn't publicly spoken about Johnny since, it's clear from those statements alone that Whitney has not been a fan of the actor one bit for some time now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZJqlkpq%2FbrTEmqmdZaOewLWx0Q%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./repentant-terrorists-are-surrendering-without-reason-army.html><span>←</span><span>Repentant Terrorists Are Surrendering Without Reason</span></a>
