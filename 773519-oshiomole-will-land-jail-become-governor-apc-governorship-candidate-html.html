I am running because I am from the camp of those that have been deprived of leadership for too long, the youth."</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>APC in Edo accused of planning to impose candidate</p><p><i>"My government will abolish corruption in Edo state. That is why the programme we have is to ensure that all our past leaders are probed. Whether they like it or not, we will ensure that whatever they have taken from Edo state, whatever they have wasted from‎ Edo state, they will bring back. And I will start from Comrade Adams Oshiomole&nbsp; , the present governor of Edo state.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;"We will visit all the projects he has done to ascertain how much he has spent on the projects and if we see that Edo state‎ has been sub charged, we will ensure that such monies will be refunded to the account of Edo state.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;"We will also visit the Airport road project. We have been getting petitions from different groups and organisations on that projects, how [the first contractor] abandoned the project and left some money unrefunded to the state. We will go into that issue to ensure that we get into the truth of it and if it is true that he did that, we will ensure that he refund with immediate effect, the money into the account of our state.&nbsp;</i><i>We will no longer allow our state to be killed by those who put their interest ahead of the state.”</i></p><p>Commenting on genuine patriotism to the state, ‎Agbomhere said<i>,&nbsp;</i><i>"I tell people I am not a comrade, I am a patriot‎. I don't know the meaning of comrade. In the Nigerian law, we don't know anything like comrade. What we have in Nigerian law is patriotism. So we young Nigerians should focus our intellectualism, our capacity and our capability in being patriotic to our state, not in being comrade."</i></p><p>The governorship aspirant also berated Governor <i>Oshiomole for "abandoning the state-owned Nigerian Observer‎ newspapers limited but spent millions of naira elsewhere to printing government letterhead papers and other documents when he needed less than N200 million to refurbish Observer printing press."</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Oshiomhole to divert World Bank loan for election - PDP</p><p>When asked how he hope to get the nomination of his party to fly its flag ‎at the election even while threatening to probe the incumbent government sponsored by the party, Agbomhere said the APC constitution is against corruption, and so he will probe the present government the same way President Muhammadu Buhari is currently probing the immediate past government.</p><p><i>"We are probing because there are so many allegations of corruption against the present government and the allegations are hampering the chances of the party in the state,"</i> he said.</p><p>Besides, he said he has consulted widely with delegates of the party, adding that more than 2,600 delegates are already behind him.</p><p><i>"We believe this is our time to take over the leadership of the Edo. We have consulted with Edo people in diaspora. These young people have resolved that it is their time to take over leadership. We have what it takes to build Edo and take it to the next level. This is the time for the change Edo people have been waiting for. I am the new face of that change."</i></p><p>The governorship aspirant promised to invest heavily in the mineral resources that abound in the state <i>"for the development and engagement of the people of Edo state."</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhHh%2FlGpwZqejnbawuc6lnGavmaG5brjAp5tmopGeuW6uxJympp1dnLy3sdGnpqtlkaWwbrPOr5yrpp%2BnwKm1z2aamqaUnrGiwMRnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marcelo-viera-html.html><span>←</span><span>Marcelo Vieira - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
