It is the beginning of elders’ activities to move the party forward in Osun.</p><p>“We are doing all our best to resolve every crisis. I can assure you that there will be no crisis within our party before the election. We come from different constituencies in Osun and we are going back to let our people know we have started to be more active than before.”</p><p>Those at the meeting include: Senator Iyiola Omisore, ex Osun Deputy Governor, Titi Laoye-Ponle, ex deputy Speaker, House of Representatives, Lasun Yusuff, Senate spokesperson, Ajibola Basiru, ex- Health Minister, Dr. Isaac Adewole, among others.</p><p>They started their deliberations around 11:15am and ended around 1:30 pm on Wednesday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5FwZmtoYmh6tbTEZqqoraSderi1y6VkrKmllr%2BmedSpZLChpJ16tbTEZqWoqqSderW7jKmpqJylmLJuwMeeZKedqKl6r7XGnqmimZ5ivbOx0qKbnqakYq6src2dnGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./woman-wants-husband-turn-down-dream-career.html><span>←</span><span>Woman Doesn't Want Husband to Take His Dream Job Because It Will Hurt His Career</span></a>
