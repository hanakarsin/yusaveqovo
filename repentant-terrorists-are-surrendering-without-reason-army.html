Gen. Christopher Musa, while speaking on the issue said, “Some of the surrendered insurgents will tell you they don’t even understand how they are surrendering and coming out in droves.”</p><p>Musa disclosed this while speaking with newsmen in Abuja while on a media tour to Maiduguri to assess the progress made by the army in the fight against terrorism.</p><p>He further stated that the theatre of operation has maintained its operations to root out the Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists from the North-East.</p><p>He added that the assumption of the Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen. Faruk Yahaya and his appointment as the theatre commander has led to more achievement.</p><p>Musa noted that the operation started in 2009, and any operation that lasts more than a decade has a serious issue.</p><p>He said, “It is the intention of the chief of army staff to see that they put an end to the menace.”</p><p>“A lot of innocent lives have been lost, and developmentally. The region has gone backwards many years, and it will take a long time before it can recover.”</p><p>He charged newsmen and the public to make it difficult for the terrorists to operate.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Nigerian Army says it has no power to <a href=#><strong>prosecute repentant terrorists</strong></a> but to profile and investigate before handing them over to the necessary authorities.</p><p>The Theater Commander, Operations Hadin Kai,&nbsp;<strong>Maj.
