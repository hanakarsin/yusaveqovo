And because we have allowed a sustained, non-beneficial stagnation for too long in our approach, the consequences are increasingly becoming more daring. The time to act is now, not tomorrow. As leaders, the choices we make create the path to our desires. We cannot pretend that all is well when indeed, more things are going wrong.</p><p>“What we have set out to do in the south western states is not targeted at any ethnic nationality or business. But we are against criminality and we shall fight criminalities with every legal means. It is in the interest of our collective wellbeing. All we require is the support and understanding of all federating units, including the Federal Government. The simple truth is that we have lived in self-denial amid an excruciating pain that is almost cancerous now.</p><p>“Notwithstanding our challenges today, my firm belief in the Nigerian Project is strengthened by my own fact of a true Nigerian. I desire a more united Nigeria with every ingredient of freedom, rule of law, patriotism, love, mutual respect and harmony is an understatement. And I am prepared to fight for it legitimately for the benefit of all.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze5FsZqehl5q%2Fqq2Mp6atZaeaua15wKScq52UpLm2edKpnJqjo2K8r3nTmqmgnaSeu6h5xa6jmqaZYrK1tM2immafoqTCsXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeremy-clarkson-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jeremy Clarkson - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
