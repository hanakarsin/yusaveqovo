So, it makes sense that fans have become pretty obsessed with who lives and dies in the show."><meta name=author content="Lourie Helzer"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

While there are folks out there who like betting on the outcomes of sports games, or even awards shows, this one boss decided to take his workers' passion for GoT and use that the show's high death toll as the basis of a betting pool.</p><p>A redditor by the name of Max uploaded a photo of the GOT-inspired betting pool his boss created, where employees can cast their votes for who will live, die, or get turned into White Walkers. They even attached some compelling bonus questions at the end for some wonderful tie-breaking and come-from-behind-victory possibilities.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><p>To join the pool, each employee just needs to fill out the sheet and throw in $10. There's some specific rules that make participating in the pool pretty fun. It's kinda hard to see them in the photo, so here they are below:</p><p>"Instructions:</p><p>1. Predict if each character will be alive or dead at the end of Season 8. 1 point for each correct answer.</p><p>2. If you predict the character dead, you have the option to predict if they become a White Walker. Gain one extra point if you correctly predict if they become a White Walker. Lose a point if you predict White Walker status incorrectly.</p><p>3. Correctly answer Bonus Questions for more points.</p><p>4. Entry with the most points wins the entire pool. Submit up to 2 pool entries per person by April 13. Pool Entry Fee is $10."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: hbo</span></figure><p>Max's boss, Diane, was cool with the idea of him uploading it online, I mean, it was her idea after all, so it was only right that he got her permission to do so. As it turns out, a ton of people in the comments were jealous of Max's awesome boss and wish they had a similar pool going at their own workplaces.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>There were also plenty of people asking for copies of the pool so they could play the game themselves, and Max happily obliged. You can check out the or click on the links in his embedded comment below.</p><p>Just make sure you guys get your predictions in by April 13, as the first episode of the final season starts the day after.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>xsupajesusx's comment from discussion "[SPOILERS] My boss made a GoT prediction sheet for all the fans at work.
