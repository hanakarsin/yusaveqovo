After the cast jets off to Pinecraft, Fla., to get another taste of the English world, Rosanna’s brother shows up unexpectedly. <a href=#>Jeremiah Raber</a> answers the door, thinking he's looking for Ada Byler.</p><p>However, Ray states his intention of finding his sister, Rosanna, and is infuriated by what he sees. The reality star’s brother enters Rosanna’s room and finds her in bed chatting with Johnny. “What the hell, Rose?” Ray angrily asks.</p><p>“I should’ve known that he was going to check on his sister,” Johnny admits. “I don’t want her reputation ruined,” Rosanna’s brother says during a confessional.

However, all may not be as it seems.</p><p>Ray believes Johnny is corrupting his sister, but it’s unlikely his Florida intervention caused them to go their separate ways. While the Return to Amish couple had their fair share of ups and downs, they’re now bonded for life.</p><p>In March 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In Touch Weekly</a> revealed that Rosanna and Johnny became first-time parents. According to the outlet, Rosanna took to her private Instagram account to announce the arrival of their daughter, Clara Rose.</p><p>“Baby girl is here,” she allegedly wrote alongside photos of their newborn child.</p><p>With a young daughter to care for, the likelihood of Ray driving a wedge between Rosanna and Johnny forever is slim.
