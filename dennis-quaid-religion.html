The gospel singer stuff, that’s not just a role he’s playing. Dennis Quaid is releasing gospel music under his own name. Dennis is a believer.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Dennis Quaid found Jesus again after a decade abusing cocaine.</h2><p>Dennis opened up about his search for higher meaning while promoting his 2023 album, ​​Fallen: A Gospel Record for Sinners. In a July 26, 2023 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> cover story, Dennis opened up about his struggles with cocaine in the 1980s and how his faith led him back to Jesus. "When you're done with the addiction, you need something to fill that hole, something that really works, right?"</p><p>Something that filled that hole was songwriting. He penned “On My Way to Heaven” in 1990. It was released in that 2018.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>Dennis spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Extra</a> on Aug. 3, 2023 and opened up even more about his ties to both addiction and religion. “Sometimes the lights were off. Or I was running away from it a lot. I tried to do it my way for so long with other things you're looking to fill that hole with. I was addicted to cocaine for quite a while. I went into rehab for that and got clear of that. They say you need a higher power to overcome that.”</p><p>Dennis was speaking about an era over 30 years in the past. He also talked a bit about his present day. “God is in <a href=#>my wife</a> and I's relationship and it's another thing that I never really had before. She and I have such a beautiful relationship, and we pray together.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Dennis explored other faiths in addition to Christianity.</h2><p>The famous actor told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christian Headlines</a> his faith wasn’t exclusive to Christianity. “I was always a seeker. I became disillusioned I think with churchianity. I dabbled in Eastern religion. I read all the texts, I read the Koran, the Bhagavad Gita, the Dhammapada, all that.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Once again, it was getting clean that refocused Dennis on Jesus. “I got clean in 1990 of cocaine, and I read the Bible again. I'd read it as a kid, and I read it again. And this time, I was really struck by the red words of Jesus. And that's really what started, I think, what I've been looking for all along -- and which, you know, my mother told me and other people [told me], but I never really understood which is having a personal relationship with Jesus. And, of course, that has grown over the years. But I never really understood it until then.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbKvusisZKqtkZ6xbr7EpaCgoZ%2Bj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./90-html.html><span>←</span><span>90 Year Old Celebrities | Famous Birthdays</span></a>
