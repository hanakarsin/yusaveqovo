Until when the government changes tactics, we won’t have peace.”</p><p>Adams recalled writing letters to all council of obas, claiming that “some big Yoruba personalities collaborate with the herdsmen.”</p><p>He stressed that “security is about intelligence and there must be a structure”, and if the country is restructured with a suitable mechanism, the issue of insecurity will be minimal.</p><p>Adams added, “Structure can only come through federalism. How can we have a supreme court in a country of over 200 million people? Every state or region should have its own supreme court; many things are wrong beyond security. We must go back to true federalism.”</p><p>On Sunday Igboho, he said, “Psychologically, it is one of the activities of the struggle, and even though some alleged that he is taking laws into his hands, it’s their opinion. I won’t support him doing that. But what we realised is that the Fulani have already taken laws into their hands too.”</p><p>The leader of the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) noted that the “coming of Sunday (Igboho) as a warrior in his own axis is a welcome development. There is nothing bad in that and definitely what he has done in recent times will encourage people, other people to fish out criminals.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze49uZputmJa%2FqnnGqK2tZZKWsKy1zaBkpKGcobKzeceeqZ2rnZq7brPAp6BmmZSWurR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./princess-leia-cousin-obi-wan-kenobi.html><span>←</span><span>What Is Princess Leia's Cousin Like in 'Obi-Wan Kenobi'?</span></a>
