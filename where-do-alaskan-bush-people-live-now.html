But after Ami's diagnosis, the family decided that it wasn't best to live too far away from civilization in case she needed to see a doctor immediately or to seek emergency medical treatment if her health deteriorated.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The family from 'Alaskan Bush People' moved to Tonasket, Washington.</h2><p>In 2019, the Alaskan Bush People migrated from Alaska to Washington after Ami's doctors discouraged the Brown family from returning to Alaska informing them that it would be detrimental to Ami's health. She was diagnosed with stage-3 lung cancer, which requires extensive medical care.</p><p>"The doctors were quite emphatic that we couldn’t go back there, it was just too hard to get her to…to set up something she would need if something happened, and we also have to go in every three months now to get CAT scans and CT scans," Billy, Ami's husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told Monsters & Critics in a 2018 interview</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Bear, Ami and Billy's son, stated that family had more importance despite having to leave behind their home. Bear also commented that they were scared housing would be anything like Los Angeles, but the Brown family managed to find 400 acres of land in Tonasket, Washington.</p><p>"It really surprised us, because it’s wonderful what we’ve got," Billy said. "The people down here, it’s a lot like Alaska to be honest with you.

The lost seems to be great! It’s still burning! I’ll keep everyone posted! God Bless!" Bear wrote in the post.</p><p>After the fire and Billy died in 2021, the family began rebuilding what was damaged, Aimee was supposed to take charge, but her children didn't want all of the responsibilities on her while dealing with lung cancer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmm6hlkaGutLfAp2SbraOderGxzqmjnmWcnsOmec2org%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-did-thor-get-his-eye-back.html><span>←</span><span>Thor Basically Gets a Makeover Ahead of 'Thor: Love and Thunder'</span></a>
