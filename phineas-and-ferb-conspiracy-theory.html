According to some fans, however, the cult-classic animation series barely touches on some of the craziest aspects of their life story.&nbsp;</p><p>Many have taken the liberty to fill in the gaps and come up with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">conspiracy theories</a> to explain the most ambiguous aspects of the narrative. Here's a list of the most outlandish theories. &nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here are the craziest conspiracy theories coined by 'Phineas and Ferb' fans.</h2><p>As the TV series reveals, Phineas (voiced by Vincent Martella) inherited his unparalleled creativity from his dad. However, some fans disagree.&nbsp;Phineas's mom, Linda (Caroline Rhea), was dating the one and only Dr. Doofenshmirtz (Dan Povenmire) during the roaring eighties. As some Redditors insist, Phineas could easily be Dr. Doofenshmirthz's son.&nbsp;According to a handful of believers, this could also explain why both Phineas and Dr. Doofenshmirtz have a strangely shaped head.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"[...] both Doofinshmertz and Phineas are good mechanics and make great inventions, also I believe in one episode Phineas' mom and Doofinshmertz dated when they were teens," opined a Redditor.&nbsp;</p><p>"I was thinking that Doof's kid is Ferb. This is why Doof built his HQ to resemble his kid. And why his 'Inators' always help get his kid out of trouble," argued another fan.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">According to another theory, 'Phineas and Ferb' only exists in Candace's head.</h2><p>As another theory has it, the adventures captured on the show could easily be the figments of Candace's (Ashley Tisdale) imagination. According to some fans, there's a strong chance that the adolescent girl coined these elaborate fantasies in a bid to cope with her little brother's tragic death.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fandom</a> reveals, some venture so far as to claim that Phineas died during a school accident ⁠— after one of his bullies punched him too hard. The harrowing incident led Candace to seek refuge in outlandish daydreams.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>This theory could also explain why the show depicts Dr. Doofenshmirtz as the evil scientist who's always eager to exploit his rare talents and cause a stir with his hideous inventions.&nbsp;Those subscribing to this school of thought claim that he is the psychologist helping the confused young woman tidy up her life.&nbsp;As some argue, this is also the reason why Linda never gets the chance to witness Phineas' and Ferb's shenanigans.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to others, Candace could be the real creator of the television show.&nbsp;Unable to make enough progress during her weekly therapy sessions, she eventually starts a diary to jot down some of her most outlandish ideas — which would go on to serve as the basis of the script.&nbsp;</p><p>Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe is slated to premiere on Disney+ in the summer of 2020.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbWqusSaqmaZnpl6p7HRm2Scp56ovaq%2BwJywZqyYmryzxQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-dies-in-halloween-ends.html><span>←</span><span>Let's Break Down the Jaw-Dropping Kill Count in 'Halloween Ends' (SPOILERS)</span></a>
