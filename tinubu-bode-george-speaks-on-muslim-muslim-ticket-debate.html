We cannot afford to conflagrate this country. So respect for the electorate. Respect for their view and respect for whatever will bring normalcy to Nigeria is what we should be doing.</p><p>“If the anger exhibited all over the country against religious intolerance and then you exacerbate it by now picking up somebody that is of the same religious sect like you how do you convince the people?</p><p>“Right now, on a religious basis, there is so much unnecessary tension created. All kinds of things are flying through the media and social media and people are more careful and conscious. Nigeria is a secular state.</p><p>“We are more conscious now. The experience of Owo and some other places have given people that kind of alert and awareness that we have to be careful. That particular parameter has been woven into the political equation of this country.</p><p>“If you think you don’t have to bother about that, it means you have no respect or regard for those who are practising one religion or the other and it will be a measure of the kind of personality that you are.”</p><p>Also speaking on the choice of a running mate for the presidential candidate of the PDP, <a href=#><strong>Atiku Abubakar</strong></a>, George said the party is still consulting and has not made any decision.</p><p>“We have not yet decided because we are considering all kinds of issues to know where the vice-presidential candidate will go to. It is not a one-man job and we cannot afford to mess up.</p><p>“It is the collective responsibility of the leaders of the party and I am sure that they have put parameters in place and my prayer is that God will direct them. If all parties make a mess, who will suffer? It is the future generations that will suffer,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5BuZq2hnqqvtnnBqJueZZeavLOzxGaqqZ2RoMBuu81mpK6rnJ66brnUrKOipV2ptqS3xK1knZ2SlsGmew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./davina-potratz-ex-husband-selling-sunset.html><span>←</span><span>'Selling Sunset' Star Relationship Details</span></a>
