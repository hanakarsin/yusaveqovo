Honestly, at times when I read what the media write here about Nigeria, I begin to wonder whether I live in the same country that they are writing about,” he said.</p><p>“I disagree vehemently with the assessment because it is unfounded and has no scientific basis. I have been the Minister (of Information and Culture) since 2015 so I know the state of press freedom in Nigeria.</p><p>Mohammed submitted that the decision of a publication to address the President by his military prefix despite currently being in power as a democratically elected leader is an example of abuse of press freedom in Nigeria but added that the government has taken no action because it allows freedom of the press.</p><p>“After all, this must be one of the very few countries in the world where a section of the media can refuse to recognize popular sovereignty, or how does one describe a situation in which a President who was duly elected by millions of Nigeria is willfully stripped of that title, President, and then cheekily cloaked in the garb of a dictator by playing up his military title? Despite that abuse of press freedom, those doing that have continued to practice their profession without hindrance.</p><p>“Ours must also be one of the few countries in the world where a reputable medium will report fake news and, when called out, will not retract or apologize,” he added.</p><p>Addressing the IPI further, the Minister charged them to ensure issues of ethics, credibility, and fake news, amongst others, are taken seriously.</p><p>“For example, on the issue of ethics, is it part of the ethics of journalism for a media organization to function like an opposition party, seeing nothing good in the government of the day and only reporting bad news?” Mohammed queried.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e5BrZqJlp6S7pbHRZqCfZaeaeq211Z5koqZdqbWmedKapJ5lk6TCr8DRsmSwoJWjeqp50Z6YnWWnna61edOhnGallZm2onnWq6CtnaNirqO71K1kp6GXmr%2BqrYylmKJlnaS1ornMnpto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-did-zoey-101-end.html><span>←</span><span>Zoey 101 Didnt Actually End Because Jamie Lynn Spears Got Pregnant</span></a>
