The last protocol they announced was that when you are in an open place, you are at liberty to do without your mask, but when you are in an enclosed place, then it is advisable to still use your mask,” Adesina noted.</p><p>The Council Chamber he said is enclosed, “there are, I think 42 ministers by the time 42 ministers congregate there, along with other cabinet office staff, it’s becoming choked.”</p><p>“Then it may not be advisable to have a full-blown physical meeting yet, but I’m sure we’ll get to that point,” he added</p><p>The budget proposal which would be taken to the National Assembly on Friday morning by the President, would be the last to be presented by President Buhari as his tenure elapses on May 19, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49uZqmZoql6sLKMrZ%2BeZWJlf3R5wa6boJ2kYrCiuoysq6KknGKvpnnApaueqpWZeqOxxaipnmWWp7alrdhmp6udo5q7ta3ToqanZaCnsrS1w56lnLFf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./413362-hadithi-ya-kuhani-aliyerejea-nyumbani-na-mikoba-miwili-pekee-baada-ya-miaka-53-yawagusa-wakenya-html.html><span>←</span><span>Hadithi ya Kuhani Aliyerejea Nyumbani na Mikoba Miwili Pekee Baada ya Miaka 53 Yawagusa Wakenya</span></a>
