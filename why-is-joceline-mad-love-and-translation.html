But <a href=#>host Sangita Patel</a> has a few tricks up her sleeve to help the potential pairs find a connection.</p><p>In this <a href=#>exclusive clip</a> shared with Distractify, we see that despite the best efforts to keep everyone on the same page, not every contestant is confident in Sangita's unconventional methods — Joceline in particular. Why is she mad in the upcoming episode?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span><p>Joceline refuses to participate in the song challenge.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Joceline has had enough in this exclusive clip from 'Love & Translation.'</h2><p>In this week's episode, Sangita introduces the song challenge, encouraging the participants to connect through the power of music. Approaching the men and women, the host tells the women they will have 30 minutes to prepare a song and 90 seconds to perform it for the men, emphasizing that the delivery of the lyrics will be their main method of communication.</p><p>"Scientists have shown that 30% of all communication is done through the tone of your voice when you are speaking," Sangita tells the contestants. "This is especially true when you're trying to build attraction."</p><p>When the host explains the task to the women, it's immediately met with side eye from some of them. Of course, the men are expected to do the same for the women, but it seems that the bulk of the task will be on the women to try to connect with the men.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span><p>Clearly not everyone is excited about the song challenge.</p></figure><p>It's then that Joceline makes her displeasure clear.</p><p>"Nope! I won't do anything," she says, immediately making it clear that this is one challenge she's not on board with. "At some point, respect must be mutual in life."</p><p>Another contestant tries to comfort her, saying "Come on, Joceline! Joceline?"</p><p>"I'm not doing anything! I don't want to! I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't want to," she emphasizes. "Don't oblige me, I don't want to do it."</p><p>It's then that Joceline leaves the group, walking over to sit alone on one of the daybeds. Cue the awkward tension among the others.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>In an effort to smooth this over, Sangita walks over to Joceline, though what she says and whether or not Joceline will choose to participate remains to be seen. Considering some of the looks the other women gave, it's possible Joceline won't be the only one sitting out of this challenge.</p><p>If you want to know what happens next, you'll have to tune into Love & Translations on TLC when the new episode drops on Sunday, Feb. 25 at 10 pm EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZKOnk5q5qrrEZqSanF2hvLexjJqlnWWkp66vv8uaq6Knng%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./we-frown-at-your-impunity-of-running-the-state-without-budget-apc-warns-fubara.html><span>←</span><span>We Frown At Your Impunity Of Running The State Without Budget</span></a>
