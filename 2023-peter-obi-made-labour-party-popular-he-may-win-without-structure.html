Before now, nobody knew the existence of the Labour Party.</p><p>“But as Obi was made the party’s presidential candidate, the party became so powerful, and it is now a party to be reckoned with.”</p><h2>Nigerians Are Tired Of APC</h2><p>Speaking further, Mohammed said the Muslim-Muslim ticket as well as the failure of the APC government in many areas which has left Nigerians frustrated and the internal wrangling troubling the PDP may just give Peter Obi and the Labour Party the edge during the 2023 elections.</p><p>According to him, the political cracks in PDP and APC may just favour Obi.</p><p>“From all indications, Nigerians are tired of APC government due to lingering terrorism affecting lives, properties, and legitimate business activities of innocent citizens of the country,” he added.</p><h2>Obi Is A Record Maker</h2><p>He concluded that even if Obi doesn’t win the 2023 presidential election, he has set a record with his growing popularity and acceptance among Nigerians.</p><p>“This Peter Obi’s first time of contesting for the country’s presidential race and he is pulling such crowd everywhere even if he losses, he has created record,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5BsZmtoYmh6sbHTnqlmp5Keeq6tw55kpZmSpMKzec%2Baqa2xXaW8scHLmqlmoJViuqLFjLCgp2WnnsGpu9StZKysoqqwtcHRnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nscdc-reveals-where-criminals-are-hiding-in-abuja.html><span>←</span><span>NSCDC Reveals Where Criminals Are Hiding In Abuja</span></a>
