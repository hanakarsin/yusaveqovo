That about 11 terrorists have been trained on&nbsp;airborne suicide missions.</p><p>The leaked memo caused a stir as people claimed the dates mentioned seem to coincide with an alarming ‘prophecy’ that Nigerian ‘Prophet’ TB Joshua gave a week earlier.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;Somali Prime Minister detained in Nairobi over security threats</p><p>The Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) later denied that the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) and Mombasa’s Moi International Airport are targets of terror attacks.</p><p>The KAA management later released a statement saying the leaked memo&nbsp;had been issued as a precautionary alert and the threats had not been verified.</p><p><i>"The planned attacks by Al-Shabaab against Kenyan airports are likely to paralyse operations at the vital installations with far reaching ramifications to national security,"</i> the memo said.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;KDF refutes Somali president’s claim that about 200 troops were killed in El-Adde</p><p>Following the news, online commentators reminded Kenyans of the ‘prophetic’ warning allegedly given by the Nigerian pastor and its uncanny semblance to the leaked memo.</p><p><i>"Kenya should pray fervently,"</i> Joshua told congregants on Sunday 21st February 2016 in a service broadcast live on Emmanuel TV, a Christian television station which has a large viewership in Kenya.</p><p><i>"I am seeing some evil people in a place where people are gathering,"</i> the controversial cleric continued.&nbsp;<i>"It could be a school, university, party - but this is a gathering. They should be very careful and tighten their security - from the end of this month and the first week of next month."</i></p><p>The Nigerian pastor then specified that the ‘Eastern part’ of Kenya should be especially security-conscious and prayerful.</p><p>Several Kenyans on Facebook reiterated Joshua’s calls for prayer in the light of the alert which has led to a beefing up of security in all of Kenya’s major airports. KAA has also assured all Kenyans and visitors that security has been tightened in all airports.</p><p>This is not the first time Joshua has ‘prophesied’ about Kenya. He allegedly predicted the deadly attack on Garissa University in 2015 which left more than 140 dead.</p><p>Joshua is one of the many Nigerian preachers who is popular in Kenya. His popularity has increased since he started broadcasting his services through his church owned&nbsp;Emmanuel TV avialable on DStv since 2015.</p><p class=h2>Who is TB Joshua?</p><p>According to the Synagogue, Church of All Nations website, Joshua was born on June 12th, 1963 in the small village of Arigidi in Akoko, Ondo State, Nigeria.</p><p>It is said his mother carried the pregnancy in her womb for 15 months before Joshua was born. The story is that&nbsp;almost 100 years before Joshua was born, it had been prophesied that a young man would emerge from the poor Oosin quarters and that God would use him mightily.</p><p>Joshua, started his ministry with eight members and prophetically naming it, ‘The Synagogue, Church of All Nations’ of which he is the General Overseer.</p><p>Watch JB Joshua's prophesy about Kenya here:</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p><i>Additional reporting by Ihechukwu Njoku, a freelance Nigerian journalist.</i></p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB9j2pnbGpdlrazvM6rq2aslae%2FsL6MsJirppmjtG6vzqKlnKGUmnq1royjpqygpZZ6sb7OqZ%2Bem6ljtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2023-melaye-reveals-spiritual-strategy-by-pdp-for-atiku-to-win-election.html><span>←</span><span>Melaye Reveals 'Spiritual Strategy' By PDP For Atiku To Win Election</span></a>
