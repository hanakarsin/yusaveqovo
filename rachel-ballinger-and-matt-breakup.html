Though Rachel is known for her comedic vlogs and light-hearted videos about her life, she seemingly likes to keep her dating life private.&nbsp;</p><p>Fans began to speculate that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel</a> and her longtime boyfriend, Matt, had parted ways at the end of 2020. Now, <a href=#>Colleen Ballinger</a>'s sister is opening up about her sexuality, and why her relationship came to an end.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Rachel Ballinger and Matt break up?</h2><p>In December 2020, Rachel's sister Colleen uploaded a TikTok video, which sparked fans to speculate that the YouTuber and Matt ended their romance.&nbsp;</p><p>In the video, it said "put a finger down if you broke up with someone this year," and fans spotted Rachel starting to move her finger down before laughing and exiting out of the frame.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Immediately, fans asked the content creator about the details surrounding her rumored breakup. Rachel has since spilled the tea on what's been happening post-split.</p><p>In one video posted in late January of 2021, Rachel told the camera: "I have not talked to my ex in over a month. We broke up in September and I have not talked to this man in over a month. I have tried because we were intertwined for eight years."&nbsp;</p><p>Rachel then started yelling, seemingly out of frustration that Matt has not responded to some of her questions. In one instance, she was upset because she couldn't log in to cancel charges that she was paying for on her credit card.&nbsp;</p><p>"I haven't talked to him in over a month. I checked my credit card statement today. He is using my credit card to buy groceries and gas," she yelled at the camera. "The audacity!"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Though Rachel has mainly stayed mum regarding her relationship and the details surrounding her breakup, fans immediately reacted to the influencer's claims regarding her ex beau.&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh girl, I always wondered what happened between you guys. I'm so sorry, but cancel that card," one person commented. Another fan wrote, "I'm so glad you got to keep the dogs. I don't know if he tried to take them but I'm glad you still have them because you're an amazing dog mom."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>This fan posted, "Y'all were very private about your relationship. I'm proud of you for speaking out."&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, Rachel's followers showed an enormous amount of support for the single YouTube personality.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Rachel Ballinger came out as gay in a vlog months after her split from Matt.</h2><p>Because Rachel has often been incredibly private about her personal life, fans didn't expect to see a tell-all vlog breaking down the details of her breakup with Matt.&nbsp;</p><p>But, she did later post a vlog about how their split allowed her to fully explore her sexuality. In February of 2021, Rachel came out as gay in a vlog.</p><p>She later posted her coming out story in another video.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"I was in an eight-year relationship with a man, He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named. When I am in a relationship, I'm a very monogamous person. I don't look, definitely don't touch," Rachel explained. "Therefore, I did not explore my feelings, or my thoughts, elsewhere."</p><p>Rachel then said that she had wanted to break up with Matt since the end of 2018, but it took her a long time to fully separate from him.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"People think [that] maybe we broke up because I was gay," she said. "No, we broke up because the relationship was just dunzo. Once I emotionally detached is when I realized I was gay."</p><p>Following the split, the 29-year-old said that she didn't feel interested in any other guys. She assumed that it was because she wasn't ready to date again. But, a cursory search through TikTok changed things.&nbsp;</p><p>"Then one day, I'm laying in my bed and I'm scrolling through TikTok. That's right, ladies and gentlemen, TikTok is the reason I realized I am gay..." she continued. "I went on a TikTok deep-dive, basically, and went 'Huh, I think I'm gay.'"</p><p>She searched through the pages of lesbian stars on the app, and she recognized feelings that she hadn't had before.&nbsp;</p><p>Afterwards, Rachel began dating women, and she started telling her loved ones the update in her life. They were all supportive.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>She later decided to tell the internet, and she noted that she received mostly positive comments from fans. &nbsp;</p><p>Now, Rachel is in a relationship with a woman. She has not shared photos or other content with her girlfriend yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp66ktMSlZJuZnKG2r7PEq2SappRiuqLA02aZq52RoMKx</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-does-malika-haqq-do-for-a-living.html><span>←</span><span>Before Malika Haqq Was on 'KUWTK,' She Was in 'Sky High'</span></a>
