Here's what we know about Brian's home life.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Brian Niccol is married to his wife Jennifer.</h2><p>Per Starbucks, and as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, Brian has set “new standards in the industry and driven significant growth and value creation" in his role at Chipotle. Clearly the coffee giant has high expectations for him as he starts his new job.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taco Bell and Pizza Hut alum</a> has committed his professional life to overseeing food mega-brands, but in his home life, his heart is committed to his wife Jennifer.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Restaurant Business Online</a>, Jennifer said "yes" to going on a blind date with her future husband because someone told her Brian resembled Tom Cruise. And the rest is history!</p><p>As for where they met exactly, it has been reported that Brian and Jennifer are both graduates of Miami University of Ohio. In fact, the couple gives back to their Cincinnati alma mater, with a $2 million donation in 2024 going toward the school's basketball program.</p><p>Their gift is aptly named the Niccol Family Basketball Award for Excellence in Academics and Athletics per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Local12</a>.</p><p style=text-align:start>The couple also helps fund the creative arts at the university.</p><p style=text-align:start>“A big part of our experience at Miami had to do with things outside our majors,” Jennifer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a> in 2020. “For Brian, that was marketing, and for me, it was Dance Theatre. I feel blessed that we’re able to integrate those interests by helping a business student achieve their ambitions, and by helping a young deserving artist become a thriving artist through a Miami education."</p><p>She continued, "I’m thrilled that dance education is evolving and growing at Miami, and I look forward to becoming more involved with the College of Creative Arts.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>STARBUCKS JUST STOLE CHIPOTLE'S CEO</p><p>Chipotle <a href=#>$CMG</a> CEO Brian Niccol just announced he has accepted the role as CEO of Starbucks <a href=#>$SBUX</a> effective at the end of this month</p><p>Chipotle has appointed Scott Boatwright, Chief Operating Officer, as Interim CEO <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Db85RYAcT0</a></p>— Evan (@StockMKTNewz) <a href=#>August 13, 2024</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Brian and Jennifer Niccol have three kids together.</h2><p>The couple lives in Newport Beach, Calif., and are reportedly parents to three kids.

If you’ve got a creative spirit, it definitely is a great place to find your trade.”</p><p>In a 2019 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Booth</a>, Brian <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">talked</a> about how Jennifer stayed home to raise their brood, explaining, "My wife, Jennifer, was a schoolteacher before we had kids, and students that she once taught still reach out to her today because she cared."</p><p>He also sweetly shared, "I’m at my best when I find time to go to dinner with my wife and get to a dance recital or a baseball game."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2Bqrc1mpaKbk6S5brnAq6minZQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./governors-attacking-buhari-are-total-failures-presidency.html><span>←</span><span>Governors Attacking Buhari Are Total Failures</span></a>
