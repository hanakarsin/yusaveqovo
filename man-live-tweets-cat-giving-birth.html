Cat lovers know what gifts from above their furry jerks are. It's hard to be too sad when you have an animal rubbing its head on your ankles and then biting them. My cat always cheers me up, or at the very least, makes me get out of bed to feed them—and once you're out of bed, you might as well continue on with the day!"><meta name=author content="Lourie Helzer"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

My cat always cheers me up, or at the very least, makes me get out of bed to feed them—and once you're out of bed, you might as well continue on with the day!</p><p>Twitter user Paris Zarcilla was having a rough day when he suddenly received an incredibly generous gift from the universe. He'd been intending to go out, and went to his room to find a sweater. Instead he found a reason to celebrate forever.</p><p>Underneath his bed was a cat he'd never met before, and she'd just given birth to the most adorable kittens Zarcilla had ever seen in his life:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So... I JUST FOUND A CAT THAT IS NOT MINE AND IT HAS HAD BABIES UNDER MY BED. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/83ktBHGgT5</a></p>— Paris Zarcilla (@ParisZarcilla) <a href=#>May 30, 2018</a></figure><p>Can you imagine? What a miracle.&nbsp;</p><p>Zarcilla was completely blown away by this unexpected turn of events:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Trying to adjust to the catshit crazy reality of going upstairs to grab a jumper but instead finding a cat and 4 kittens. Am I dad now?</p>— Paris Zarcilla (@ParisZarcilla) <a href=#>May 30, 2018</a></figure><p>He obviously had to turn his life around immediately:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Cancelling all my plans. Crawling under the bed to spend the rest of the day with my four new children. <a href=#>#newdad</a></p>— Paris Zarcilla (@ParisZarcilla) <a href=#>May 30, 2018</a></figure><p>Thankfully, Zarcilla live-tweeted the transcendent experience, and we all got to see these magnificent creatures:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Cuteness update: I'm dying. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/fJWUVnlNKh</a></p>— Paris Zarcilla (@ParisZarcilla) <a href=#>May 30, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I am living for these babies.<br>Any work commitments I have are now temporarily on hold. Sorry I'm a dad now.</p>— Paris Zarcilla (@ParisZarcilla) <a href=#>May 30, 2018</a></figure><p>The transformation into a certified Cat Dad was basically instantaneous. Zarcilla gave up all his usual worldly pleasures for the benefit of his new cat babies:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Just cancelled my order for comics and single malt whiskey.

Like, I feel high. Is this what it feels like to have a child? I think I'm falling in love. Fuck. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0ObNMNt4vC</a></p>— Paris Zarcilla (@ParisZarcilla) <a href=#>May 30, 2018</a></figure><p>But actually, it was just enough. Zarcilla shared that he'd been experience a lot of emotional turmoil, and had been having difficulty coping. Having these creatures to enjoy and care for was exactly what he needed:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is too much. I'm approaching nirvana. I legitimately suffer from anxiety attacks and depression and my capacity to deal with it recently has been waning. The Cat Gods have smiled upon me with benevolence and turned the monsters under my bed into kittens.</p>— Paris Zarcilla (@ParisZarcilla) <a href=#>May 30, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Is it unhealthy to get tears on kittens? Is it unhealthy to cry about kittens? Asking for me.</p>— Paris Zarcilla (@ParisZarcilla) <a href=#>May 30, 2018</a></figure><p>Things began to get a little dramatic, but that's okay. Who wouldn't be dramatic about suddenly becoming a father?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>To my cat sons and daughters, I'll be the hero you deserve, but not the one it needs right now (because of mama cat). So I'll hunt for you, because I can afford it. I'll be your silent guardian, your watchful protector.

Possibly now as a different person. Reborn as <a href=#>#CatDad</a>. Wiser. Hairy-er. Learning secrets of the universe and life through the unexpected birth of these gaddamn fluff miracles. Praise be to the Cat Gods.

Unexpectedly discovered more than kittens but also the hidden depths of my own capacity to love. Cat Twitter, thank you. You've been a wonderful source of support. My brain has divided by 0 so <a href=#>#CatDad</a> must sleep. More tmrw. Much love x <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4Zj4biyIRd</a></p>— Paris Zarcilla (@ParisZarcilla) <a href=#>May 30, 2018</a></figure><p>People were completely taken in by the story, and are still following it with baited breath. There are some issues.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ohayo gozaimasu! Cat mama has had a rather sleepless night (as have I!) But here are the first family in all their fur glory. Praise be to Bast 🙏 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/aGbtLRG37D</a></p>— Paris Zarcilla (@ParisZarcilla) <a href=#>May 31, 2018</a></figure><p>A lot of people pointed out that the mama cat may not belong to Zarcilla, but she could belong to someone who is looking for her. Many suggested he take her to get scanned to see if she has a chip. He wrote in other tweets that he called a veterinarian who said she shouldn't be separated form her babies yet, and they'd need to wait to bring her in. No one had a portable scanner. Basically, Zarcilla is realizing he may not be able to keep his bounty... but he might make a run for it with his kittens.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Beginning to experience the dread and emotional turmoil of the idea that I might have to give up the fluff blessings at some point. This may be someone's cat and I don't want to take away this joy from anybody. But my dad instincts have kicked in so hard. Fuck. I want this</p>— Paris Zarcilla (@ParisZarcilla) <a href=#>May 31, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Right... moral compass ruined.
