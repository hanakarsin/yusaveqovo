So, this is an unplanned deficit. We have gone to the National Assembly, and we have got approvals. The approval was simply to cut down on some of the investment costs. Some investments that we needed to make in the oil and gas sector, which we are delaying and deferring to a later time, and reducing the rollout of those investments.</p><p>“But we also had asked that we needed to borrow money, which is very serious. Already, our borrowing has increased significantly, and we are struggling with being able to service debt because even though revenue is increasing, the expenditure has been increasing at a much higher rate.</p><p>“It (petrol subsidy) is impeding the government’s ability to be able to invest in human capital development. N4.5tn is money that we could have invested in health or education, but we are now investing it in consumption, which is very wasteful. How many Nigerians own cars that are benefiting from this subsidy?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGidrp2cYsC2rtKim7Jn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-is-suge-knight-in-prison.html><span>←</span><span>Why Is Suge Knight in Prison?
