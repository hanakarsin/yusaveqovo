According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, Kodak and two other individuals attempted to enter the U.S. at the Canada-New York border with a temporary California registration. Things went south for the songwriter when police discovered he had weed and found an undeclared Glock 9mm pistol in the vehicle.</p><p>Kodak (real name: Bill K. Kapri) was allegedly arrested for criminal possession of a weapon and possession of marijuana. Three other people connected to the musician, who were traveling in a separate car, were also charged after officers found three loaded guns and marijuana in their vehicle.</p><p>Ironically, Kodak’s tour bus showed up to the Boston venue without him and became the site of a mini riot led by a group of irate fans.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by DJ Akademiks (@akadmiks)</a> on Apr 17, 2019 at 8:07pm PDT</p></figure><p>On Thursday morning, TMZ reported that the Florida native had been released from custody on $20,000 cash bond.

Kodak wrote the tune, titled "Expeditiously," in response to a video T.I. posted on his Instagram Live.</p><p>The duo began feuding on social media after Kodak talked about his plans to pursue the late Nipsey Hussle’s grieving girlfriend, Lauren London, claiming that he’ll give the actress a year to mourn the rapper's murder before making his move.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>T.I. and his wife Tiny.</p></figure><p>Following his comments, T.I. became one of Kodak’s most vocal opponents and the pair traded barbs on Twitter before the 38-year-old took their beef into the studio.</p><p>T.I.’s lyrics clearly address the feud: "I'm conditioned to see the vision, you/I don't care if you eight or under twenty-two/All that back and forth, what you trying to get into?/I said what I said and I meant it to[...] N--ga took it too far, better slow down/Your belief becomes your thoughts, then your thoughts become your word."</p><p>Kodak once again took things too far with his reply, dragging Tiny into the conflict. "How you tell me what came out my mouth, you don’t even know Nipsey/Tiny that b---h ugly as hell, I don’t even want Piggy," he raps on the track.</p><p>If we had to guess, we’d say T.I. is thrilled over Kodak’s arrest. What’s that famous saying? Oh yeah: Karma’s a b---h.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBut86dmKRlkqGupLeMpqCsq5mjtG6t0aucrKyVmQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./imogen-poots-html.html><span>←</span><span>Imogen Poots - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
