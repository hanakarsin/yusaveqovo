"Like who she wants to be part of her life and who shouldn’t. She will be focusing a lot more on what’s best for her this season... She learned that she doesn’t want to miss out on anything because you never know what could happen tomorrow."&nbsp;</p><p>It's no surprise that the hype around the return of On My Block has fans wondering if Netflix plans to renew the series, or if it will follow the fate of the streaming platform's other Latinx series, One Day at a Time.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, will there be a Season 3 of On My Block?</h2><p>Yes! Several members of the cast got together to share the good news. Julio Macias, who plays <a href=#>Oscar "Spooky" Diaz</a>, told his followers on Instagram, "Found out we got Season 3. Guess I got to lose these," he said taking off his glasses, before adding, "and a little bit of that," referring to his hair.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Diego Tinoco (@diegotinoco)</a> on Apr 29, 2019 at 6:23pm PDT</p></figure><p><a href=#>Diego Tinoco</a>, who plays Spooky little brother Cesar, also took to social media to get fans excited for a third season. "So you guys don't know this yet but the season finale of Season 2 is we get kidnapped," he shared in a fun video. "And well, we don't know who kidnaps us exactly. Who could it possibly be? Well, you guys will find out very soon. Season 3, we're coming for you."&nbsp;</p><p>No release date has been announced but if Netflix follows its usual pattern, Season 3 will most likely debut in March 2020.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened in Season 2 of On My Block?&nbsp;</h2><p>In case you need a recap, Season 1 ended with an unexpected shooting at Olivia's quinceañera. Earlier Cesar (played by failed to kill rival gang member Latrelle, which resulted in him coming to the party for revenge. Instead of shooting Diego, Latrelle missed and hit Olivia and Ruby instead.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Nicola Goode/Netflix</span></figure><p>In Season 2, viewers watched as Ruby struggles with grief and survivor's remorse. Throughout the season, Ruby experienced the stages of grief, from anger to denial to acceptance, with the help of his friends.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Jamal, who discovered the Rollerworld treasure and is now $200,000 richer, has to figure out a way to "wash" the money so that Cesar, who is on the outs with his brother and Los Santos, can get out of town.&nbsp;</p><p>Monse has her own dilemma when it comes to her birth mom, who forces her to choose between living with her or her dad. Plus, Latrelle returns to Freeridge, adding even more pressure on Cesar and the gang.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Nicola Goode/Netflix</span></figure><p>As expected, everyone is affected by Olivia's death, not just Ruby. "Everyone will be affected by it. That was&nbsp;definitely a tragic situation. Some people will be affected more than others, but everyone will definitely be changed afterward," Sierra (Monse) explained.</p><p>&nbsp;"For Monse in particular, it will force her to grow up. Her perspective on life and how things work will shift a little bit. She was aware of the fact that life’s full of trials and tribulations, but now more so than ever, she realizes that you’re gonna have to deal with things you’re not always prepared for and you have to take life as it comes."</p><p>Stream On My Block on Netflix now.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpLtuudhmmaWnk6B6tLHArKanZWM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-do-the-vanderpump-rules-cast-make-per-episode.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Do the 'Vanderpump Rules' Cast Make Per Episode?
