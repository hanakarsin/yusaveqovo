Reducing his pay is unconscionable!&nbsp; A man earning ₦18k struggles to pay rent, feed family & pay school fees. To reduce his pay is to punish his family. If FG & state govts dont pay workers well they invite workers to steal. To end corruption we must pay workers well.”</i></p><p>State governors under the auspice of Nigeria Governors’ Forum at their meeting reportedly complained about the minimum wage of N18, 000 stating that they can no longer pay due to the dwindling economy of the country following the fall in oil price at the global market.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO</strong>:&nbsp;See The Salaries And Allowances Of National Assembly Members</p><p>In a related development, Governor Adams Oshiohmole of Edo state had stated that the N18, 000 minimum wage must be paid against all odds, thereby disagreeing with other governors, who were skeptical about it considering the present economic situation in Nigeria.</p><p>He added that the minimum wage was in force since the tenure of the previous administration and wondered why his colleagues were calling for its reduction now.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3WClW5rZqWZo7auwcxmrpqflWKvprqMm6mum5VixKK%2BzaxkoKemmr%2Bvu9GsZaGsnaE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./b-smyth-html.html><span>←</span><span>B.
