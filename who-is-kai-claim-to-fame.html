Since its premiere, viewers have turned into amateur FBI agents, desperately trying to figure out the identity of each contestant. Though viewers initially struggled to figure out Kai's celebrity relative, the contestant's housemate Amara guessed correctly on Tuesday night's (August 16) episode.</p><p>So, just who is Kai? Distractify spoke exclusively with the ABC star following her elimination from the competition series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/p36wiDWF7/0x0/who-is-kai-claim-to-fame-1658241022184.jpg><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Kai on 'Claim to Fame'?</h2><p>In Episode 6 of Claim to Fame, Amara finds herself in the bottom and is ultimately named the guesser. Feeling confident about Kai's identity after reading her clue, Amara correctly guesses Kai's celebrity relative: Tiffany Haddish.</p><p>Kai's real name is Jasmine English and she is the Girls Trip star's sister.</p><p>After being eliminated, would Jasmine have played the game any differently if given the chance?</p><p>"Not a thing! I played the game how I could play it. I am horrible at faking friendships!" Jasmine told us. "This just wasn't the type of game I could win. I'm a terrible liar and I have zero negotiation skills, and alliances in this show required a lot of all of that. It’s just not me; I am honestly surprised I lasted as long as I did on the show."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Well, one person who was certainly rooting for Jasmine was her sister.</p><p>"My sister watched the first two episodes and then got busy with super star stuff," she dished. "Knowing her, she is likely going to wait for all the episodes to come out on Hulu and binge watch."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Claim to Fame' star Jasmine, aka Kai, says she "went into defense mode."</h2><p>Though she was aware that Amara and the rest of the house had correctly guessed her celebrity relative, Jasmine revealed that she "went into defense mode" and tried to "convince her it was the wrong guess."</p><p>However, Amara could not be swayed.</p><p>"I am a horrible liar and an even worse negotiator," Jasmine laughed.</p><p>While Jasmine told us she was happy to leave the house and go home to see her family, she thinks that her co-star LC is playing "the best game" at the moment.</p><p>And, we have to agree. LC seemingly has a lot of allies in the house.
